It seems that part of this mental health issue may come from your physical state, coupled with your relationship troubles, so the anti depressants and exercise may remedy this. Even if this does not work, it is very unlikely to do any harm to try this path.

I also would suggest trying to find relationships through engaging with the world, rather than through dating apps.
