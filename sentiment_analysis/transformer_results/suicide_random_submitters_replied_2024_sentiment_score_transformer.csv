u/Awkward-Spring1411,137,"I got too much love as a child. It’s ruined me. I’ve come to the conclusion lately that I do not want to live and function as an adult. I shouldn’t have to have any commitments or responsibilities. I should have died age 7. My life has been downhill since then. 

My parents loved - and still love - me so hard, it makes me hurt inside. I don’t know if that makes sense? I refuse to look for romantic love because the only people I want to care about are them. The more years I spend masking my true self (because nobody - nobody - would ever suspect I’m like this; me, the attractive, successful career woman who has bought her own apartment and been living independently for over ten years), the more I want to give it all up and just move back in with them and totally regress. I want to regress to the age I was when I didn’t know of negative emotions, or anxiety, of grief and loss. I want to be ignorant. I am both saddened and filled with rage that growing up happened. I want it to be just the three of us forever. To play with Barbies with my dad in the garden. I want to see colours as brightly as I used to. I want my mum to hold me tight. The love I experienced in my childhood is like a chokehold. On a bad day, old memories is all I can think about. I cycle through them in my brain and cry until I have no voice left.

Nobody asked me if I wanted to be an adult. Nobody checked with me. I watch my friends get married and have kids and I’m like why. Why do you want to adult so badly? How sad that you are now taking care of your own children. You should still be children yourselves. Why the fuck are we getting older?

And then, because everyone seems to be going down that path, I start thinking ‘What gene am I missing that I turned out so wrong?’

I would like to die a dignified death with my parents in a couple of decades’ time. I can hold on till then if I know I get to go with them. I fully intend to end my life as soon as they go, but I am hoping that they might be interested in looking into options of going the three of us at the same time.

I really wasn’t meant for this world.",u/Awkward-Spring1411,9,"But what if I don’t want that love? I don’t want to be sought out by or date what is essentially a stranger. I don’t want romantic relationships. Those are for grown ups. I don’t want that. I don’t want to meet new people. Each new person I meet is just an extra person to mask around. Don’t get me wrong, I won’t be milling myself today. But I know that inevitably I need to start slowly making plans so that I can end things when my parents pass. | ‘Terminal nostalgia’ is right. The only reason I’m hanging on until my parents die is because I don’t want them to suffer me passing first (if it happens naturally then yay for me).

I’ve known since I could first form thought that this world was not a place for me. | Thanks. But I don’t want help, I just want my life to end. | It’s not the same. I want zero responsibilities.

I don’t want to ‘grow up and find a partner and get married and have kids’. I should be the child. | I don’t want to let go of my past. I categorically refuse to. I couldn’t care less about new experiences. Meeting new people. I want none of it. All I want is to go back in time. | This is me. In my mid 30s and for the last ten years it’s been the same. Breakdowns a few times a week and masking well on the outside. I don’t want help because unless someone can magic me back to when I was a kid I don’t want help. | Thanks, this is exactly it. There is nothing like the warmth and love you experience in childhood. You are responsible for nothing. Have no commitments. I just don’t think it’s possible to have that life as an adult. As an antinatalist I truly feel like we are all better off dead young. | That sounds like work and effort. It’s good that you are doing that and find joy in it, but I don’t want to put on work and effort to be happy. I didn’t have to when I was a child, and that is what bothers me. I shouldn’t have to now, either. | The only thing that was stressful about my childhood was when I got old enough to begin experiencing negative thoughts/anxiety and began to pick up on bad things.

u/IceeAmericano,348,"I’m killing myself when I get off work I think I’ve finally hit my breaking point. When I get off in a few hours, I’m going to sit in my car, smoke the rest of my cigarettes, then drive off an overpass.

I’ve been applying to jobs for the past two years. Seven years of work experience, a Bachelor’s with Honors, internships with the federal government, and thousands of applications, yet all I’ve been able to land is a barista job in a roach infested cafe making peanuts. I’ve done everything everyone said was right, but now all people can say to me is, “the job markets just bad now,” or, “you’re an amazing candidate, but we won’t be moving forward.” Seems that this is really all I’m worth after all.

Edit: People have made fair points about surviving the fall in a car, so I think I will instead jump headfirst. The interstate is busy enough that someone will be bound to hit me afterwards, anyways.

My friend, who has previously been very open about being suicidal and has been worsening throughout the past couple months, stating he'd commit suicide within the year, joined a voice chat I was having with another friend, and said that he almost died without elaborating. Then, a couple minutes later, he started randomly repeating an exact date, time and location. February 3rd, 10pm, along with a location I will not say. I tried finding this on Google maps to see how close it was to his house. After a bit, he sent me and my friend a link to Google maps street view. It was the location he stated, a view of being on a bridge with train tracks beneath it. The hint was obvious. On Saturday, my friend is going to try to kill himself.

Edit: I have spoken to my parents and will speak to a school Councillor tomorrow, and take it from there. If I don't update this, I either forgot to edit or didn't manage to save him.

Edit 3: Im making this edit to tell you guys you don't need to be concerned for him and that he'll be fine. His mother is aware, not his father for personal reasons to him.

Hey guys. Writing this the day after. He attempted suicide. He did this around midnight last night. He sent a message and ten minutes later I saw it and quickly got my parents to call his mum.

u/Medium_Rest3537,152,"I'm so depressed that my reasons for suicide are becoming more logical instead of irrational. It's like I keep coming up with reasons that it's more logical to kill myself than stay alive. 

1. Why be an emotionless husk when I could potentially reincarnate into a happier life?

2. My circumstances are the reasons for my depression, but there are only so many externally forces you can actually control.

3. If the afterlife and god exists, that makes my life pointless because I'm just going to reincarnate into some worthless fag in the next round. And I hate people who AREN'T me.

4. If there is no god or afterlife, then I'm embarrassed that I'm this shit-slinging ape-type life form instead  of something with enhanced intelligence and invulnerability.

5. I cannot use fiction as an escape anymore because it makes me feel like those worlds are real and I could go to them if I offed myself.

6. People who circlejerk how beautiful life is, funnily enough, make me want to kill myself even more because of its absurdity. They don't actually believe that, they're just under the influence of simple caffeine.

7. If the all loving source is real and it feels better than being alive...well idk guys. I thought spirituality was suppose to make me want to live, not convince me to go. 

In short, human beings cannot make up their minds and I'm embarrassed to play along with you.

u/Neither-Homework-957,173,"girlfriend tried to commit suicide again today and i don’t know if i can go on.  my girlfriend has struggled with severe depression her entire life and has had 12 hospitalizations for SI. the first time she had an attempt while we were together it was absolutely heart wrenching. she was calling me from the hospital telling me that she was going to find a way to kill herself in there. i felt immense fear until she was home and thankfully, she felt somewhat better from a new line of medicine. three months go by and she’s in same position. she’s been bed ridden with depression the past month and i’ve been trying to do anything in my power to make her feel better. today i thought she was in a good mood and she went out to doordash. after figuring something was wrong after she turned off her location and told me she loved me and her plans to immediately commit suicide- my heart stopped. i immediately called 911 and went out looking for her. it was a scary hour but long short the police got her and have taken her to a hospital. these few hours living at home without her- and trying to sleep are miserable. her energy is my lifeblood and her comfort has saved me. i love her so much and i can’t live without her. she always tells me in episodes that one day she’ll kill herself or have the courage ect. it’s all i can think about. that i have a ticking time bomb on the love of my life. i can’t take the anxiety of it. not being able to hold her ever again is reason enough to stop wanting to live. i know im so dependent and this is my fault in a way i guess.

u/Pleasant_Shoe_7856,400,"I asked all of my friends to come over for for a drink so I could see them all one last time and none showed up To be fair, there’s only 6 of them. Everyone’s home from college for the summer so I was just hoping to see them one more time. They all said yes but either cancelled this morning or didn’t show up without saying anything.
so now I’m just sitting here with 24 cupcakes I made, some spinach dip and salads. I also now have 72 cookies because I baked them each a dozen cookies to take home.

I’m honestly more sad about the fact in a couple weeks they’ll probably feel guilty about it, but it’s not really their fault because they didn’t know it was their last chance to see me.

I’m so mad at myself for trying to set this up. I should have known they wouldn’t want to come, because they don’t invite me when they hangout. I try not to bother people but I just wanted a little closer, I mean we were friends ever since we were little girls. I think we were all 3/4 when our moms became friends.

I’m pretty much in a position with no other options, so I don’t need anyone to talk to. I can’t really talk through any of the issues anyways. Thank you though | Oh this situation has nothing to do with my reasoning, it was sad but I made up my mind far before this happened | It’s the end of suffering not additional suffering. This post does not explain even 1/4 of my reasons. | No, I don’t really have issues to talk about, They aren’t anything that will be fixed by therapy. Therapy helps mental illness but not things I can’t control. I’m sad, but I don’t have any mental illness. 

And I guess I have friends, none of them showed up though so I don’t know if that’s a reason to stick around lol | Well here’s a list of a few
When I was 14 my mom died in her sleep. my brother got addicted to drugs because of it and left. My dad started dating a year later and I got abused by my step family, he took their side and hardly talks to me but paid for her kids to go to university.
I went from one abusive household to another, and I will be 25 in February and have no money, no education and if I try to leave my husband I will be dead anyways. Even if I got out alive I have 12k in student loan debt from one year of college that I failed out of, I don’t have my own credit card anymore or my own car. 
Ending my own life peacefully is 100% the best way out. | Yeah I completely disagree, there’s really nothing a therapist can do to fix anything other than my mindset. And for my personal issues mindset doesn’t change anything | It won’t. If therapy could fix my issues I promise I would be going, but there is zero chance. Unless that therapist has some magical powers and can wave a wand and fix my completely messed up family, bring my mom back, get rid of my abusive husband and somehow come up with enough money for me to get away with him, and then take me back 5 years so I could have a career. Then maybe I’d go. And even if I wanted to, my husband would never in a million years let me see a therapist, he didn’t even want me to have friends over. I’m almost 25 and I don’t have a single dollar or education. | Even if I get away from him I have no education money or work experience, And no matter how bad he treats me I’d take him over my family any day, so it’s not like if I get out I have a support system. 

Leaving a relationship like this one is also not as easy as going to a women’s shelter. If I try to leave I’ll be dead anyways, I’d rather do it on my own terms. | I totally get it you’re trying to help and I appreciate it but that is not an option for me, and won’t help me. My cop husband would have me pulled over before I ever got to the shelter. 

And honestly even if there was a slim chance I wouldn’t take it. Like I said I’m almost 25, I don’t exactly have years and years to figure things out anymore. Even if I do leave, get therapy, save money, go to school, everyone else my age has their own place, degree and job. There’s not much point in starting now just to be able to rent a crappy apartment by the time I’m 30 | Like I said, a women’s shelter will not help me. I get it people are trying to help but I don’t think any of you understand how hard it is to leave someone who works in law enforcement and won’t face consequences. Even if I get to a safe place it won’t be safe when he tracks me down in a week. | Yeah in a perfect world that would all happen, but that’s not how it will happen. I get it from the outside it seems like it should be that easy, but it’s not. I have tried to leave, and I can tell you right now how it’ll end if I try again.
And in the slim chance I do get out, it’s not like I have a good life waiting for me just because he’s gone. 

Im definitely not the first woman to be abused by a cop, there’s a reason abuse is so high in this profession.

I’m sorry, I get it everyone’s trying to be nice but I am not going to a women’s shelter.

u/Plutosunrise,764,"Teen daughter tried to commit suicide. Found her suicide note today Throwaway account.  Daughter(14) tried to commit suicide Sunday night by taking a lethal dose of Tylenol and Advil.  Luckily school has been hitting the suicide hot line pretty hard with the students and she texted them before and after taking the pills.  They were able to convince her to give up our address.  Wife and I were home and had no idea until a frantic police man came up to the door.  Long story short, she survived with no permanent damage.  She started inpatient care yesterday.  We went thru her phone and the texts to the hot line indicate she has been having these feelings for two years.  We started going thru her room today and found her note.

Fantastic grades, lots of friends, very well liked at school, and highly empathetic towards others.  In her texts to the hot line, she was guilt ridden on how good her life was.

u/SecretAccurate2323,137,"I am a worthless raped pig Story of my life is that im just a used cunt. Was raped as kid when a man close to my family decided to fuck me. Basically he just would tell people he was taking me places, but then get mad at me for random shit and fuck me. Things he punished me with rape for: getting sunburned, wandering off, letting my swimsuit top slip down, walking too slow, growing boobs, not finishing my food, not calling my mom to tell her where i was, not speaking to him in English, rejecting his kiss. He also would hold me down and let his friends have me. He rubbed oil on my nipples and took pictures of me splayed out. I remember him and his friend laughing together about how wet I was, saying that I liked it, and taking pictures of me to prove how much i liked it. When I started growing boobs he pinched them painfully and said I was a slut, and then laughed that my nipples got hard. I remember him sitting on my chest and forcing me to take his dick in my mouth. He also drugged me once and had me like that. He took pictures and videos of my body. 

As a teen I had relationships with older men where I would get emotional support from them and help and in exchange send them nudes and basically be their camgirl. I was so depressed at this time and would slash open my own vagina afterwards to punish myself. 

As an adult Ive been raped twice. One was so violent. He chocked me and beat me up and I got brain damage that I still struggle with.  Basically im a stupid fuck doll now too. 

The other rape was just some horny asshole. It still fucked me up though. Ive tried to kill myself a few times, but im too weak to go through with it. 

These rapes are the defining feature of my life. Im just a stupid used up cunt who deserves to die. I hate the sounds I made while being raped. I still remember listening to myself. I could not control myself and sometimes made little whimpers and squeeles when something hurt too much and i felt like my insides were ripping open. My rapist laughed at the sounds and said i liked it. I'm nothing.

u/Secretquestions23,205,"15, Christian, caught watching porn, wanna kms On Friday night my parents caught me watching porn, and exactly like the title says I wanna kill myself. It’s an addiction I’ve had for around a year, already kinda wanted to die because of it, after my parents caught me I tried to talk to them about it and tell them it’s something I’ve been struggling with, rather than trying to help/support me they just keep screaming at me for how I’m such an awful person now. I’m a fairly devoted Christian, that’s about the only thing stopping me from suicide. That’s why I already hated myself for watching porn and being addicted, it’s extremely against the Bible and I couldn’t quit. Don’t really know where I was going with this, just kinda ranting, sorry for making you read such a dumb post but yea I’m debating suicide and whether I’d rather give up my faith and kms or try to stick it out and figure out what to do

Edit: wanna clarify, my parents are not Christian’s. I am for reasons you all would probably call me an idiot for lol. But, I’m glad I posted, I’ve realized I should quit worrying so much about what my parents (who have abused me my whole life) think, and that it might not be normal for your own parents to make you suicidal as often as my parents do",u/Secretquestions23,44,"I don’t believe my parents even are Christian’s, my dad I know isn’t he’s never claimed to be but my mom says she is, however based off the things she says to me everyday I can kinda make an assumption she might not be, I’m sure it sounds kinda dumb to you or anyone really who Hasn’t had this same experience as I’m about to tell you might not understand it, but the main thing that really pushed me to become a Christian is the fact that I used to love reading but I’m crosseyed and it’s gotten to the point I quite literally just can’t read a book anymore because I simply can’t focus my eyes on it…but somehow I manage to read my Bible 

I think your right, though, I think I just need to quit thinking so much into what my parents (who have always been kinda abusive, and I practically raised myself) are saying and more into what God says and what’s in the Bible, I know I’ve sinned but He can forgive me and I need to figure out how to forgive myself | I had never heard of that before, I just googled it and it sounds just like what I’ve been experiencing…I’ve always had severe anxiety (like quite literally maxed out every test out there severe) and mild depression and that’s part of why all these things get to me too, I don’t have access to a therapist my parents practically call me an idiot anytime I’ve mentioned therapy but I think it might be a good idea to look into that further | I think you might’ve slightly misread (that’s not meant to sound rude, might be overthinking but in my brain it does when it’s not meant to) but my beliefs are basically the only thing stopping me from ending my life…it’s possible I mistyped too, I kinda just vented, I honestly just don’t know what to do anymore after their reaction they’ve always been abusive and I’ve practically been the only “adult like” person in my life since I was under ten, basically raised myself, now all of a sudden this happens and I’m just a horrible person and no matter what I say it just keeps getting worse and worse until we’ll as you read I just wanna die | I’ve never been allowed any sort of privacy whatsoever, I literally get screamed at if I accidentally lock the door when I shower lol, but I have had a hard time trusting them to talk to because of things like this and they just freak out at that too, this time they keep telling me they don’t understand why I didn’t talk to them before if this was something I struggled with and then they go straight back to their screaming about how awful I am | If I’m being honest after reading some of these replies I’ve realized every time I’ve been suicidal in the past it’s had some direct link to my parents, it sounds bad to say but this time at first I didn’t think it was a big deal and honestly I was almost glad they caught me, because it’s something I’ve struggled with and I hoped they could kinda support me, but I’ve been trying to give them space to think and they just keep constantly calling me out of my room to do nothing but scream and threaten to take everything they know is important to me, then I go try to sit back down and before I even have my door shut they’re back to screaming.

Last time before this I was suicidal a few months ago, it was my weight. I’m quite a bit underweight, but they kept telling me I eat too much (which before I started eating less was under one full meal a day) and calling me fat and by the end I quite literally almost killed myself with how little I ate and weighed

I’m not gonna keep rambling because this reply is already so long, but I think I’m starting to realize I might just need to quit listening to the things like this that my parents say, clearly they aren’t the best for me, I practically raised myself since I was around seven and I do literally everything maintaining our family/house if you get what I mean, I think I just shouldn’t let them get to me anymore (and I don’t mean don’t listen to them, just to quit letting these things bug me so much) | That’s something I’ve been working on, I honestly don’t remember how I ever found it but since I was around twelve probably it’s something I’ve struggled with and I’ve been slowly getting better about it and I want to quit, I’ve tried telling my parents that and that I’ve been getting better in hopes for their support and instead well this post wound up being the result, but after reading all the replies here I’m really glad I did post, a lot of you guys have been really helpful and it’s nice to know I’m not alone, my parents have told enough lies about me I don’t have anyone in my entire extended family to talk to so it’s nice to know there are people here who care! | I really like your outlook on this, I’ve been trying to quit but every time I relapsed then I just kinda felt like God would hate me for it, and then because I thought that I’d just keep relapsing for a while, but I don’t really know why I ever did think that, I read my Bible and I know he can forgive me so I need to quit thinking he wont | I know it’s bad, and I’ve been trying to quit and I’ve actually gotten quite a bit better, they just seem to care more about screaming at me for it than trying to help me like I asked them to, quite literally I can’t get them to say a word to me about anything besides this now and everytime they do nothing but scream, I know God can forgive me but now I need to figure out how to forgive myself, and how to get them to quit screaming lol | Thank you for those websites, I think that’s a good place for me to start, I need to forgive myself too. I’ve been suicidal like this a few times in the past, and after posting this on starting to realize that every time it’s been something to do with my parents, last time it was all the things they said about my weight (I’m actually quite a bit underweight but they decided the opposite) and They said I ate too much (apparently half a meal to one meal a day is far too much) and I quite literally almost killed myself with how little I weighed and ate, but I’m realizing it might not be normal for my parents to make me debate suicide as often as I do…? | Yea kinda wish I could say it is | I’ll be sure to look that up, thank you!! | I think that’s a good idea, rn I’ve been trying to get my drivers license but last time I asked my parents to teach me to drive (I have my permit, I got it three months ago) my dad refused to speak to me for a week, and since my parents aren’t really Christian’s we don’t go to church but after I do get my license that’s something I want to do for reasons like this | Well honestly I guess I kinda only ever started thinking of it as an addiction because of my parents reactions and how they kinda freaked out, it’s never changed any part of my life really and I don’t think about it very often, but after they reacted the way they did I started to think a little worse about myself and it

I’ve been suicidal in the past, a few times, never posted about it just kept it to myself (though I’m glad I finally did this time), but thinking about it now I’m realizing every time I have been it always has a direct link to my parents in some way-last time before this it was my weight, I’m actually a decent bit underweight and hardly eat at all (like literally 1/2-1 full meal a day typically is the most I can eat) but my whole family felt the need to comment everyday about how fat I am and how I eat too much, I just about killed myself not with a knife and not with a gun but with how little I ate and how little I weighed, even when I was at my lowest they kept on making comments, finally I quit listening but I just thought of it and yea I’m kinda realizing the fact that in some way my parents make me debate suicide as often as they do might not be normal…? | Thinking about it your right, the way my parents reacted I haven’t been able to get them to say anything besides screams about this for the past three days, but I shouldn’t let one bad reaction, especially from people who have abused me my whole life, basically destroy my life | I mean honestly the only reason I ever have been adult like is because I had no one else who was, I don’t necessarily want to be but when I basically have to raise myself and do everything myself I kinda had to be lol | Well one thing for a while I’ve wanted to do is to go to culinary school, but we’ll I’m a boy and my family has made very clear that is absolutely not ok (I also crochet, horrible I know lol I’ve never liked hunting or fishing and I’ve never heard the end of how awful I am for not liking those as a boy) and I also do really enjoy coding and art are both things I’ve considered going into one day | Yea they kinda are, they’ve always been physically, emotionally, and mentally abusive and every time I’ve ever been suicidal it’s had a direct link to them, I think at this point I need to figure out how to just quit letting them bug me with these things | I just want to reply quick and let you know, I’m not ignoring you, quite honestly when I posted this I kinda just figured maybe one or two people would see it and instead I have almost a hundred fifty replies lol, and just about every single one is full of great advice like this one. I’ve replied to a lot of them, but I haven’t quite replied to all of them and that’s mainly because those are the ones I’ve really been thinking about (like this one) and I’ve actually been researching some of the things in this one and I think they’re really good ideas, but quite honestly my brain is just thinking about too many things right now and I can’t quite process them all at once and figure out yet how I’m going to respond to each one-but I’m not ignoring you and I actually think it’s a really good idea lol | Well that’s about the right description of them, I have quite literally been screamed at in the past because I had a pimple on my face.

u/ShaiHallud24,106,"I'm afraid of NOT being suicidal Whenever I'm happy or on the rare occasions I feel a sense of hope about my life, I dial it down a bit. I'm scared of being afraid to die. I FEAR fearing death. When your suicidal, you feel like ""Fuck it, let's get it over with"". 

But when I'm happy, it's like ""Maybe I don't wanna die. Maybe I don't want this to end."" Then the anxiety kicks in and I'm overthinking about all the things that could kill me. 

I guess being suicidal is a comfort. It's like i've been sad for so long that I don't wanna be happy. I often downplay my achievements or happy moments in my life. I always think ""Yeah, I'm happy now but later something bad is gonna happen"" It's like I equate everything.

u/Short-Resist-2139,108,"I have been suicidal for the past 25 years. It’s time. Hi folks. I made a throwaway and came as far from the socials I normally use because I just wanted to leave my feelings here without judgement, without guilt tripping with “oh your poor family” as if they weren’t a large reason I’m here right now. I have nobody. I have nothing. I’m functionally homeless. All the good things in my life are overshadowed by pain. I’m extremely mentally ill and despite my intensive work in therapy and psychiatry, I still find myself desiring to pass in my sleep daily. I have a lot of medication. Not even from hoarding, I have so many fucking conditions I’m on a plethora of pills. I have been sexually, physically, emotionally abused.

u/ThrowRA_mm03,152,"Tired of people's attitude toward suicide I'm so fucking tired of how suicide is taboo, how I can't find like-minded individuals to talk to, how people always think talking about suicide is about either encouraging suicide or suicide prevention.

I don't fucking need anyone to talk me in or out of offing myself. I have about a thousand different ways ready whenever I want to do it. Hell, I could jump out the window from my 15 stories high apartment anytime.

I just want to be able to talk to someone without there being worries or people trying to talk me out of it. Being suicidal is being gaslit by the entire world because they think I should abide by what they think is best for me.

My first trist with suicide was when I used to hang myself by the neck from the closet bar using a very thick sheet, just for sheets and giggles. I was 4. There has always been that impulse for ending my life there. Most of my life I had to spend every day trying to convince myself that life is great and beautiful and worth living and that is really tiring.

The main problem with suicide is the people who get left behind, I get it that they suffer from the loss, but I suffer constantly from living. Sure I'm trying to diminish their suffering, so I don't intend on jumping head first from a window, because I know they'd like a not-mangled body to mourn over, so there's that. But in an ideal world, I'd just put my affairs in order, go to a facility, have all my blood and organs donated and then die peacefully.

I'm just so sick of not being able to talk about this.",u/ThrowRA_mm03,6,"> mentally stable and healthy ppl

Gee, thanks, that is really helpful | I've gone through this with my therapist and they were like ""why didn't you talk about this before?"". And I have, in the kinda distant past, but I have more pressing matters in my life.

I really really tried to be a good person. I wanted people to like me so I lied about who I was, but I felt bad about lying so actually became who I said I was. I faked it till I made it. And then I failed because hiding my emotions and problems just made them spill out and burn everything.

u/bobblead,162,"i hate being black so many races out there and i got unlucky :/ i really hate my life, i'll never get these years back and i'll always be stuck in this family with this life forever. i will never ever be white no matter what so i've really been feeding myself a ton of false hope. just feel so unhappy these days",u/bobblead,7,"i will never have a white childhood or a white family or have experiences with white people because everyone in my area when i was younger would tell their kids not to hang out with me because black people always fight and are dangerous. i hate everything about myself and if i were born as any other race, not only white, i would be happier and more confident and feel more human. i don't feel human i feel worthless and like an alien especially since my parents pretty much wanted me to get bullied by giving me an alien type name that nobody can pronounce. maybe if i were white i would have an easy simple normal name too but pretty much i hate my life and i didn't choose to be black. i hate everything about it | mainly because it is out of my control and i didn't choose it. 


some people will assume i'm aggressive, loud and ghetto and treat me accordingly. others will assume i'm ""trying to be oppressed"" and that being black is actually great and i'm just looking for a reason to complain. if i were born white or any other race, none of that would happen. remember that this was not my choice at all. nobody wants to be unhappy, i have tried my entire life to appreciate my skin and culture but i still feel very unhappy and disconnected to it. 


i feel like everyone is just judging me all the time and wants me to die. and i feel like both left-wing and right-wing people hate black people and think we're all miscreants. but if i were born as any other race, which could have happened, i wouldn't have to feel like a burden both economically and socially and i wouldn't live in my shitty family because i'd have a white family instead. i would just be happier and feel validated more and not always seen as a bad person. 


currently, i pretty much allow anyone who's white to walk over me because i would rather they make my life hell than i make them uncomfortable and maybe even confirm what they assume about me (that black people have a short fuse and are violet and commit crimes and we're scary and threatening and we aren't really human: try, apes, monkies or gorrilas). i always assume at the back of my mind that white people are always right and they belong and own this earth and country i'm just a subhuman who should be grateful to even be alive. i feel worthless compared to every other race, not only white people. seems like black is the most hated race with the worst stereotypes. 


i don't want to make this post last forever but i feel like the only thing stopping people from still hanging us and shit is just the law and fear of prison. i think innately, people feel fear or threatened by us and that makes me feel very miserable all the time. nobody sees us as human so nobody can sympathize with us. i can't even do anything about it and i can't physically change my race, it's not possible and especially in the summer as my skin is getting darker. i feel miserable all the time. i really wish i could be white - it's not fair that some of the things i have gone through that i twist and turn about at night wouldn't have happened if i wasn't black. im not implying white people or other races don't suffer, i'm talking about the conext of the personal things i have gone through. nobody would choose to be miserable, remember that. nobody who is sane would choose to be miserable, anything i am sad about is something that i have tried and tried to not hate myself over and see the good thing in. but when all the copes and all are used up, the reality is that i am still black and everyone still hates me either because i am pretending to be oppressed or because i'm a ghetto ruffian who loves committing crimes. so i still hate myself and nothing will fix that, even if i magically became white today, i will never get a white childhood and i'd still be stuck in this family and i'd have my experiences that still make me miserable. | keep assuming im trolling because you don't believe someone can be unhappy in their body.",1c0zg9e,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1c0zg9e/i_hate_being_black/,-0.9918177127838135,0.7801983952522278,1.7720161080360413,significant positive

Today's the day, and tonight's the night. I don't really have anything planned for today really, just do the chores my parents gave me, proofread my letter one more time, and just pass the time with video games and YouTube until tonight. I've already scouted out where I want to do it. Not at my house since I don't want to scar my family any more than what they're already gonna be from this. I plan on doing it at my local park. It's got a big field way on the outskirts of it. Peaceful, with a good view of the stars too. I plan on waiting until everyone goes to sleep tonight, take my last shower at about 10 pm, and write 2 more on-paper notes. One for my family to find in my room, telling them to call the police and telling them the location of my body, and one on my body telling the police that my suicide letter is on my phone in my notes app. I'll walk to the park somewhere between 12 - 3 am and just look at the stars for a while. Might drink a little too, play some music. Once I've said my prayers and my last words, turn my gun onto myself, pull the trigger, and see what happens from there. These past few days have been strangely peaceful actually. Feels like I've got control of my life for once and that I actually know what's gonna happen.

I'd like to thank everybody who left comments or sent me pms after my last post. All of you are amazing people and you will hopefully go on to do great things with your lives. Thank you for giving some comfort in my final days. 🖤

u/indierock24,928,"Switching From Passively Suicidal to Actively Suicidal Actually Gave Me Relief? *Has anyone else had this feeling? Or find it somewhat relatable?*

I \[24M\] have been passively suicidal for a few months now, but yesterday was an exceptionally awful day. I slept super late, I forgot I was scheduled to work, couldn't get dressed, couldn't leave the house, tried to fix my bike but ended up breaking it even more. Then I gave into pretty much all of my self-sabotaging vices (drugs, porn, shitty food, video games, you name it). 

  
I swear something snapped. I cried a *ridiculous* amount throughout the day and spent the rest of the night feverishly reading up on suicide. I actually figured out my gameplan. I found a whole document outlining the specifics and answered all the little questions I had (sorry not sharing — don't even ask me) plus a backup option in case I'm desperate enough to do something quicker. For now, I'm in the stage of acquiring the materials and getting my affairs in order.

  
Since I got my suicide method figured out, I'm in a strangely upbeat mood. 

It's an odd paradox. Finalizing my plan of action to end my life made me feel motivated to go out and live it. I'm getting chores done with no sweat, I'm dancing and listening to fun music, I'm gaining bits of my personality back. A great weight has been lifted off my shoulders.

From what I heard, it's common for people to act calm or joyful the days before they make an attempt. Is that what I'm experiencing? Maybe it's because I have a goal now? Like my days don't feel meaningless like they persistently have? Or maybe finally there's an escape route to break free from the shitshow that is my life. I don't feel as trapped and hopeless anymore. 

Anyways, I wanted to see if this anyone here had a similar experience or wants to weigh in on this situation.

TL:DR - I'm actively suicidal for the first time in my life and I feel much better after I figured out my method. What's the meaning behind this?

not in a morbid sense, or an elitist sense, but some people live their entire lives without feeing depressed or suicidal right? 

maybe some of us are just meant to be fucked idk. | I disagree with your opinion on medication. To be frank, I think disregarding medication entirely like that is extremely dangerous, especially to those who struggle with mental illness or depression.

Thanks, I know for a fact you understand how I feel. | Yea I do.

Granted, it took me a couple tries with a couple different warm lines, but when I tried the one for my local area (a line that doesnt have to deal with *too* many callers at once), but that lady might've saved me from going down a different path that day, or maybe even that week.

The point of warm-lines is to call for pretty much anything, as a preventative measure before people have to rely on hotlines (which as we know in this sub, has varying quality).

u/ninski2000,531,"I am commiting suicide in 10 days, I feel like I'm the worst person in the world. I have been keeping a big secret for 4 years now. My family thinks I have been going to university for the past 4 years but little did they know, including my friends and relatives, that i dropped out in the middle of the first semester of my freshman year. I managed to keep it a secret from all of them by forging false documents and giving them assurance every time they ask me a question about how my academics was going. It also helps that the University is 2 hours away from my home so I actually rent near it. I go home every weekend thinking ""do they know already?"". I know a lot about my field as I practice it every now and then by working with a licensed engineer. I don't make a lot of money from it though but the things I learned that is connected to the degree program is what kept me from blanking when asked by my family about my academic life.

I have run out of time. The graduation from the University is 10 days away and everyone thinks I am graduating. And I am somewhat happy, that I can finally end my life. I have been such a big disappointment for my parents. I am their only child. I cry everytime I imagine what my mom would feel after I do it. My girlfriend, who by the way also doesn't know anything broke up with me yesterday, which makes the goodbye part of it all very hard.

Since i don't attend classes anymore, i got a once a week job from an engineering firm nearby for extra income. I feel so sad for my parents because they've been so good to me my whole life, and this is how i repay them. But the greatest blow to me is whenever i ask myself ""what would my mom feel about my death and how would she cope with it"". And the worst thing about all of this is the fact that i am an only child. After my death my parents would have no children anymore to keep themselves busy, i'm afraid they'd have a very very very hard time coping the death of their only child.

The world is overpopulated anyways, some of us are suffering inhumane amounts of pain and just want to leave with some dignity. I already know what life feels like and I just want to get out. 

Nobody will hurt if I leave, in fact their lifes will be better, I'm sure. Every decision I make turns out to be wrong, I can't do what I'm told, and the fact that they thought so highly of me growing up hurts even more. I mean, if everybody saw no future in me, it would've been easier. I was my family's only hope of getting out of poverty, I was supposed to make their dreams come true, I wanted that. But how could they know? I was such a wonderful kid for them. But I was awful since I can remember.

I know it sounds stupid but can someone just tell me not to leave the house? Like we don’t even have to talk or anything. I just want to feel like one soul on this earth is actually making the choice for me and telling me to stay. So I can cop out. Please. I want someone to take the blame for being the reason I stay home instead. 

I’m like a fucking damsel in distress and I can’t make my own fucking choices. I just need a cop out.

I am beyond grateful for every single comment I got. I cannot stress that I really was about to go, but I didn’t. You’re all very good people. I feel shitty for having taken up your time, but also so grateful that people cared. Thank you so much. 

Edit2: omg guys. I feel so loved. I don’t know what happened last night, I just sorta got weak I guess. I’m not usually THAT bad. I mean, I have depression and everything, but it’s usually manageable. You all helped so much.

Thank you all for the love you showed, my inbox is absolutely overflowing. I wanna respond to everyone… I feel like you’re all my friends checking in on me. I know we’re strangers, but having notifications is just strange for me. I’m not used to it at all. I don’t have a lot of friends. Or any, really, besides my siblings.

I had a fudge bar before I got up to leave, I might have another one in a little while. Idk if I have the energy for other stuff right now and eating ice cream seems doable. That’s something I enjoy doing lol | You’re so sweet taking the time to respond.

Thank you so much for caring. I genuinely didn’t think I’d get a response… I think my shock at having all these replies is helping sorta snap me out of my head space from earlier. 

You’re all way too kind to me. <3 | I will update you! It’s 23:00 here right now and I might fall asleep soon because I’m just very tired from tonight… but I will update you | You’re so kind, thank you. I will. | Oh fuck you found my weakness… I can’t disappoint the cats!! I also don’t want to disappoint you, the human lol… I just really like cats! | That’s what I usually tell myself! I often think “well if I’m gonna die anyways then I might as well put it off a little while and play some video games” or something. I’m naturally curious and my curiosity will always win out when challenged. So I can just think “let’s see what happens next” and usually ignore the bad thoughts. But last night they were just all encompassing and drowning out my other thoughts. 

I woke up safe today though, so I’m ok now.

I am getting sleepy though so I’ll update everyone tomorrow that I’m still here <3 | I promise to take a hot shower as soon as I wake up, but I’m pretty much falling asleep right now. I didn’t leave, and I didn’t touch the pills. Tomorrow morning I’ll update everyone and then I’ll go take a shower <3 thank you.

Thank you for responding. | I did, thank you for caring <3 | Omfg this is making me cry again (dont worry, it’s appreciation tears!)

I often am in your shoes in these times. Last night I felt a little more desperate than usual so I posted, but I truly didn’t expect anyone to respond…. Everyone was so nice to me I literally didn’t know what to do. I figure responding to them all would be best. 

I mean had I only gotten a single comment I would’ve felt better, I would’ve listened to them. But now all these people care? Holy shit. Idk if you’ve ever seen the Grinch movie but in it his heart grows bigger in size - that’s how I feel from all these comments. And you have no idea how grateful I am that you are also benefitting from this post 😭

Idk if it’s against the rules here, but anyone here can hit me up and we can be friends? I don’t have a lot of friends so idk how to really do this lol… but yeah. I’m not the best at socializing and I forget to respond a lot, but I still care, you know? <3 | It’s so hard to convince myself of that when it’s really bad. But you’re right, and it’s a lot easier for me to believe you now. I decided not to leave, I just went and laid in bed instead. You’ve all been so helpful, if nothing else because I’ve been so distracted reading and responding to the comments I haven’t had time to reconsider leaving haha

Thank you <3 | You’re right. I tend to be the “class clown” of groups of people, so I know this is true. It’s so easy to make other people smile and laugh, but so fucking hard to do it for yourself. It’s kinda ridiculous. 

I ended up going to bed safely and now I’m awake the next day. I’m ok, and I’m gonna be ok for now. Thanks for responding <3 | Omg I am so proud of you! I dropped out of college and haven’t figured out what I want to do with my life… which is crazy because I’m not THAT young anymore lol. I have a few ideas of things I want to do going forward but idk if they’re good ideas. 

Congratulations on graduating!!! And thank you so much for your comment <3 I often wonder why I’m going through the pain I go through, but then I consider that maybe it’s so my experiences can help others one day (when I’m less vulnerable myself and able to help). 

Thank you <3 | I’m safe! I woke up today at around 9:00 something, but I just laid around for a few hours half asleep. It’s 11:00 now but I also deleted some emails before coming here - haven’t been just a sleepy lump all morning lol

Thank you for caring <3 | You’re 10000% right. It really just gets extra hard when the sun goes down. It’s morning now and I feel a little better. Not perfect, but better than last night by far. I don’t want to die, I was just scared and confused. I felt like there was shadows, or like black mist, and it just was consuming me. Metaphorically speaking. I couldn’t see my way out and needed someone else to just TELL me to get out. It really helped seeing all these comments. I feel beyond overwhelmed with love and appreciation. 

Thank you so much <3 | Hot chocolate is a great idea. It’s morning now but I might do that anyways. I also promised someone else here that I’d take a shower, so I’ll do both of these things. Shower and cocoa! 

You’re all so good to me <3 thank you so much. I am overflowing with appreciation | This is the second comment about hot chocolate, so I guess I have no choice! <3 lol

Thank you for caring. I feel indebted to you all. | I stayed home, I went to bed safely. It’s morning now and I’m ok. Thank you for caring <3 | I feel better yes, thank you! I am not at my peak but I’m definitely not in the horrible place from before. I even brushed my teeth lol. Thank you so much for taking time to comment here <3 I appreciate it so much | Fuck. Thank you. 

I really do feel like I take up time and space. Like I’m an annoying, ugly living room lamp that nobody likes but you can’t get rid of. I mean, I really don’t have EVIDENCE of this, but I still feel it. I try to make everyone as happy as I can, but then I often feel so burnt out from it. I’m trying to prioritize myself more, but that’s so hard too. Ugh. Nothing is ever easy. 

I went to bed last night and woke up ok! I didn’t touch the pills or anything. I’m ok now. I’m not like, the best I’ve ever been, but I’m not going to die. I’m going to drink some hot cocoa, take a shower, and then see where it goes from there. I’ll be ok.

Thank you so much for your comment. Everyone here has helped me more than they know… I’m trying to respond to everyone but there’s SO many notifications coming in. I appreciate it more than you know. I feel overwhelmed with this care for me. <3 | I did! I’m ok now (it’s morning). Thank you <3 | Thank you, you don’t know what it means to me. I’m ok now (it’s morning) and I brushed my teeth. That’s already a step ahead of my expectations of myself. <3 thank you | Thank you!! I definitely felt the good vibes, I am doing better now in the morning! I woke up and laid around for a bit, then brushed my teeth and washed my face. It’s not much but it was more than I usually would expect from myself. So I blame the good vibes for giving me the energy I needed <3 you and the effort you put towards me means more to me than you know. | I wish I had the words to express my appreciation for your comment <3 and everyone’s comments. I’m drowning in love from total strangers! It’s crazy. Thank you for caring! | Yeah that’s one thing that really made this scary for me. Usually my plan is to do it a lot more painlessly (I’m terrified of pain) but it was just so… impulsive. Idk. Last night I was overcome. Like the shadow monster that’s always creeping nearby just sorta overtook my mind and didn’t let me think right anymore. I have wanted to die a lot of times, I’ve even planned it out and written notes… but last night was some other kind of beast. I never would’ve wanted to die that way. It just sorta culminated last night for some reason.

I’m better now! I didn’t do anything. 

Thank you for commenting <3 | Me too <3 | Thank you! The leaning thing is exactly it. Sometimes I forget I’m “allowed” to lean like that. I pushed almost everyone away irl and now I’m struggling. I’m trying to build up that support system again so I have someone to catch me when I fall. And in return I’ll catch them when they fall too. 

Your comment is so sweet <3 and the emojis are so cute, I never get to see the pink hearts in the wild! 🩷💖 but my favorite one is the light blue heart lol 🩵 it’s just so crisp looking! | You’re so sweet <3 thank you for responding. I am ok now, I’m safe. I didn’t do anything and I just went to bed. I feel a little better now in the morning. Thank you so much | You are all so beyond sweet to me, I’m drowning in love right now! Thank you for your comment <3 I went to bed last night and woke up safe. I’m ok now. Your words help more than you know. 

Thank you! | Thank you <3 even these comments after I’d decided to stay home are genuinely helping me. I brushed my teeth and “washed my face” (I just sorta splashed water on it and dried it off lol). I wasn’t going to do that, I was just going to stay in bed until I had the energy to get up and shower or eat… I truly give the credit to these extra comments I have this morning. I feel like… idk how to describe it. Like I’m hogging all your time that could be spent on better things. But I’m also so grateful too. It’s conflicting. 

Thank you for your care <3 | Thank you for caring, I am so grateful for everything you’ve all done for me. I’m ok, I’m safe now. I went to bed and didn’t do anything bad. I’m awake now and I’m trying to be better! Your care means more than you know <3 | OKAY! I didn’t go, I stayed home. Thank you, I don’t know why it helps that someone else tells me to stay. It just makes it easier somehow. You’ve helped me more than I can express <3 thank you | Thank you, I may not know you but I know these words now. I may not know the pebble but I know the ripples it left in the water. 

<3 | Honestly this has become a party now hasn’t it? I know half the comments are my responses but there’s 138 on the post right now. Holy HELL that’s a lot of comments! 

Thank you. I’m not sure what my “big” reason is, but I have a lot of little reasons. I just didn’t see them last night. Like, I want to finish The Boys tv show. I want to see the aurora borealis. I want to draw out the comic idea I’ve had and post it online just to see what happens. I want to have another pet cat. I want to eat good foods. 

It’s just sometimes that creeping, exhausted darkness gets a grip on me and it makes me all foggy. Last night was the worst time so far, but yeah. I’m better now! I’m going to be better for now. 

Thank you for caring <3 you’re all strangers but you’ve all been acting like my friends. It means beyond the world to me. | You’re right. I hope I can pay it forward one day. I’m so tired today, but maybe tomorrow I won’t be as tired. Maybe it’ll take more than a day and that’s fine. I just need to rest and get my strength up again. 

Thank you for being a crutch for me right now. I am beyond grateful for all this care I’m receiving <3 | Thank you <3 I slept well, and I appreciate your words so much | Thank you <3 I am so grateful you care | You’re all so kind. Thank you. So much. <3 I appreciate it all so much. I can never properly explain my gratitude. | Thank you. I didn’t leave. I went to bed and slept instead <3 I’m ok now | Yeah, I think we understand each other. I’m trying to eat breakfast right now but I just keep looking at the two biscuits I have and feeling absolutely no appetite. I’m trying to take the steps. I’m just so tired. But I don’t want to be tired, you know? I want to be hungry. I want to eat. I’m just so tired. 

I’m trying though. And I don’t think I’m doing horrible, if I’m comparing to last night. Every time I get bummed today I just look at this post and all the comments and I try to like… squeeze out the energy these people have put here so I can just take one more step. 

I’m better now, but still drained and tired. I brushed my teeth earlier and now I’ve got these biscuits. It’s been four hours since I woke up though lmfao. I feel so slow. I’m doing my best tho

Thank you for commenting <3 I’m glad you’re here right now. It helps knowing someone understands. I believe in you, too! Maybe if we believe in each other then we can lighten the load. I don’t have to try so hard to believe in me when I know someone else is doing it for me, right? <3 | I stayed <3 hugs back! | You don’t know what this means to me. Especially right now. I’m trying to eat breakfast and it’s just really hard, but you saying these things makes me feel a little lighter in my seat. Thank you. I love you too <3 | Thank you <3 you’re too kind to me | Thank you, you’re so sweet! It’s hard for me to see that beauty, but thankfully I’m an overly trusting person lol so I’ll try to take your word for it. I’m overwhelmed with love from all these comments. Thank you for taking the time for me <3 | Fuck now I’m crying again. Thank you. I feel like I’m surrounded in a big group hug with all of you. It’s overwhelming but also so nice. I keep reading comments as I go through my day and it’s like little bursts of wind underneath my wings helping me stay afloat. 

You have no idea how much your comment means to me. And I know I’ve said that for a lot of comments now… but it’s all true. I’m overwhelmed with appreciation. Thank you. | I know pills are a bad choice… that was never the “real” plan, it was impulsive. Like a panic choice.

Thank you for taking the time to comment <3 | Thank you <3 x | You’re so kind <3 I’m sending a thank-you hug back! | I do that a lot of times (knowing someone else had it worse than me) - I got heavily into philosophy over the quarantine time and I read a lot of stoicism. It’s weird how most of the time I am so good at keeping a really level head, but then in a crisis it all just disappears as if I never learned it. 

Thank you for the reminder tho! I am using these comments as grounding whenever I start to float away again. This helps more than you know <3 | Honestly! It feels like I’m laying in bed and everyone else is forming this safe entity who’s gently petting my hair as I cry myself to sleep. It’s so nice. I feel like a little child being taken care of. 

Thank you for your comment! You’re part of that safe entity now too <3 | >Permanent solutions never fix temporary problems 

Honestly I should just tattoo that to my hands. I’d say forehead, but I don’t have enough mirrors for that to be a realistic aid haha. Thank you for being here for me <3 I appreciate it. | You’re all so beautiful and good! I feel like I’m drowning in love every time I open this app. I’m so grateful <3 thank you | I actually did end up telling my brother. I’m kinda having a fight with my dad right now (unrelated to the post, we’ll be ok) so it’s awkward talking to him… but my brother has been helping me. He’s younger than me but still so valuable. 

Thank you for the tip <3 | Ok, I didn’t!! <3 | I appreciate it <3 I’m not really religious, but Jesus has never done me wrong either. Thank you for the care 🩷 | Thank you, it feels stupid but it really does help. Following instructions can be sooo much easier than making choices. Thank you so much | You’re so considerate, thank you 🩷 I’m starting to really love the pink heart emoji after all these comments… it’s making an association with the comfort this post has brought me. Thank you, and I hope you’re doing ok to, stranger!! | I’m not super religious, but I truly do appreciate it. Religious people get a lot of flack, but I’ve had a couple insanely cool Christians in my life who genuinely changed me for the better. 

A youth pastor named Jason once helped me through an insanely bad time in life. His care for me was so important. I didn’t think anyone cared, but he took time to visit me in an inpatient ward TWICE. For no reason other than to check on me. I will never forget him. 

So I’m definitely thankful that Jesus made it possible for Jason to be there for me. <3 | I just woke up and I’m feeling better - not best, but better! I just wanted to update everyone as best I can. <3 thank you | Thank you, I wish I could hug you all as a thank you… I woke up feeling a little better than before. I am going to put the pills away so they’re not in the bag anymore. I feel so bad I made everyone worry, and I’m so grateful so many people cared. You have no idea how much your comment meant to me. How much it still means to me. I feel indebted to you all. <3 | I’m doing my best to not give up, but it’s so hard sometimes. Also happy cake day! It sounds dumb but seeing the little cake emoji by your username kinda makes me feel better lol. Like … 1% better, but still that’s more than none haha | Omg you’re all so nice to me, I really don’t feel like I deserve it. I won’t make us do the whole circular thing where you’ve gotta convince me to accept your care for me, so I’ll just accept it and say thank you <3 | I slept alright! Today I was doing a bit better when I first woke up, but I’m not nearly as bad as I was last night. I’m just tired from it all. I’m trying to eat breakfast biscuits right now. 

To be honest I can’t remember the teas I’ve tried… I definitely have tried lemon/honey stuff, but beyond that I couldn’t tell you the flavors I’ve had. There’s a tea shop near me that lets you drink the teas before buying them and they have a chocolate tea that’s AMAZING… but it just sorta tastes like cocoa. Idk how “tea” it is. There’s a vanilla one that’s the same, but I don’t know the brand names or anything… | Thank you <3 if you ever need to talk yourself, my dms are open, I just might be slow to reply | Thank you <3 I ended up eating 1.5 biscuits (I cut them in half to butter and jam them, but didn’t eat one of the halves). The first one was hard, the middle one wasn’t, and I forced the third one a bit. 

Maybe next time the first one won’t be hard, or I won’t have to force the third. I’m trying to be proud of myself, but knowing you are proud of me makes me feel better too… you’re all being so kind to me it’s blowing my mind. Thank you, I feel indebted. | You’re so nice to me, I appreciate it all so much. I wish I was more… idk, verbose? I wish I could use words better to express just how much I appreciate and am grateful for all the love you guys showed me last night. 

I woke up safe this morning in my bed, and I feel better now that it’s no longer dark out. Thank you again <3 | To be honest, less than ideal. I am not at that lowest place anymore… but the feeling in my gut, as if there’s a really heavy rock settled in my stomach, is still present. I haven’t done anything dangerous though. I’m trying really hard to eat a little bit each day, and I still haven’t made myself cocoa like I promised the other comments…. But I’m taking really tiny steps otherwise. | 🩷 thank you.

I’ve never written anything down.
I’ve put my gun in my mouth a few times but this just feels different, like I can’t even swallow correctly now. | Thank you for the insight and sharing your experience. 
I always think about killing myself, and have a set date to do it and what I’m going to do. 
Tonight was weird, like it wasn’t even a bad night.
I just went to my room and started writing.
What made me start crying was addressing my older brother, I don’t want to hurt him or feel like any of this is his fault. After i finished writing I laid  in bed and just started sobbing uncontrollably. Fucking weird, I hate it tbh. | I plan on it, I just don’t want anyone to feel the “if I reached out” thing. I feel like what I do is inevitable when the time comes. | That makes a lot of sense.
It’s just weird, the wave of emotions but none were “sad” i just couldn’t hold it together and kept crying. 
Thanks for the offer, at the moment I need to gather my thoughts. I appreciate it immensely. | I’m glad to hear you’re still here. Keep it up! 
After the first sentence I could feel the tears coming up, and I didn’t know why- I didn’t feel sad, or angry. 
I’m going to try to fight as much as I can, tonight was actually an eye opening experience.
I hope this post will be something I can look back on one day and see how far I’ve come mentally. 

Thank you for the kind words | I started crying uncontrollably when addressing my brother. I don’t want to hurt him. I’m just confused about what’s going on | Thank you! Merry Christmas to you too!
I’m actually relieved this sun isn’t toxic, I was hesitant on posting but the support here has been helpful.
I hope you’re doing well🖤 | I’m glad you’re still here 🖤
And I think that’s what got to me, knowing it would bring him pain. I leaned heavily into reassuring him it’s not his fault and not to feel guilt. 
Just thinking about right now what I wrote him makes me feel like I can’t breathe. This sucks man | I hope you’re right. I’ve felt like killing myself for a very long time now, i feel like life doesn’t have much to offer. | Well I mean like as a teen I started having suicidal thoughts but I thought it was just because I was “edgy” and “emo” but they stuck with me throughout my life. Now It’s like this inner monologue, sometimes it’s the only thing I can think of, most times it’s just in the back of my mind, but it’s always there. Tonight nothing in particular happened, I just went to my room and started writing. I’ve never written anything like this before, as soon as I started writing to my brother and my final wishes  I just started sobbing uncontrollably, but it wasn’t like I was sad, or angry I just couldn’t stop crying for like 30 minutes.

I’m a firm believer in crying to let out emotions, but this was different. | That’s something I’m going to actually start keeping in mind.
Everyday up until tonight I’ve never felt like what I’m going to do would impact them (very much)
I don’t feel useless by any means- I just feel like there’s nothing to live for. | Yeah I have seriously considered it.
It’s weird, it’s like this inner monologue that never goes away. Sometimes it’s in the back of my mind and sometimes it’s all I can think about. 
I understand what I do can’t be undone, and that it’s going to affect people I love horribly, but I just don’t see the point of living. 

I’ve never wrote my suicide note and the crying really caught me off guard, it wasn’t like I was sad or mad. I just getting crying uncontrollably in my bed. 

Honestly I have never told anyone about my feelings. I don’t want the people I love to worry about my mental health.
This is the first time I’ve ever posted about something like this- thus the fake account. | That’s the plan, just take it one day at a time at this moment. I’m Hoping I never feel this way again. | that’s how I felt too.
Like “well there’s really no going back now is there?” I really felt that way until I posted on here and read about others experiences.
I’m gonna take it one day at a time and reflect on what I felt like tonight. 

Glad you’re still here 🙂 | Honestly no I don’t think so. I do know that would be my ideal way, due to no pain and the speed. 
I think about it when I drive, when I’m at work. Sometimes when I’m at work this inner monologue starts up and says word for word “man I have so much better things to do than be here.. like jumping off this building” | I’m so sorry to hear that, I hope you are feeling better. 
I really don’t want to hurt my brother, but often I just don’t see the point of living. 
I’m trying to stick around for a long time, but the feeling seems to always be present. 

Honestly i don’t even talk to him about this, I don’t want to make him worry, since he lives out of state. | Thank you so much for the kind words. I wish you the same🖤 | I don’t know how I would to be honest. 
I’ve never brought this up to anyone.
This was the first time I’ve ever spoken about it on this post.
In the past he was the only reason I didn’t drive to desert and shot myself. God damn man | I hope so. Life just seems black and white. 
It’s weird, I don’t consider myself “sad”, I’d say I’m a relatively positive guy but there’s always this inner monologue that eats at me. Sometimes it’s stronger than I can think. But no matter how tiny, it’s always there. | I don’t know.. I’m 35 and have felt this way since my teens. I figured it was my mind being “edgy” and “melodramatic”, but the thoughts stuck with me.

u/throwaway8t437,217,"Finally got my gun permit. Picking up a gun later this week likely. I've realized over time that the only truly painless way to die would be to blow my head off. Nothing left. With hanging, you choke or break your neck and die. With drugs, you'll likely just end up getting very sick and throwing up. Jumping off a bridge? I'll be scared the whole way down.

But a gun? I get to just pull a trigger, and bam. Black. I'm honestly excited.

Just gotta make sure to aim it correctly so I don't end up one of those misfigured freaks. I'll probably just stand by a body of water so if the shot somehow doesn't kill me I'll drown while unconscious. 

Sorry mom, sorry dad. Sorry to everyone. I just can't deal with this shit anymore. I'll be remembered as the lazy chump who blew his head off.

I appreciate the concern though, thank you kind person. | Have felt like this for well over a decade. Eventually realized it really doesn't get better, only worse.

I stood on the edge, lighting the last cigarette, I took a drag and looked down. The faint hum of the city coming through the headphones, the cold breeze in my hair. It felt almost magical, enticing, beckoning for me, almost begging me to take the step. 

A song started playing. Rises the moon. It broke  me out of the trance. My ex girlfriend used to sing it to me whenever I felt under the weather. I stepped back, fell on the ground and started crying like I never cried before. Everything, all the emotions and feelings I stuffed down and ignored for the past couple of months (because I couldn't let myself feel, had to focus on keeping and getting life in order) just came out.
