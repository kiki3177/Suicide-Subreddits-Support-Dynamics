u/Leather-Bend5813,7,"I dont know how much longer I can take this (may be triggering) I apologize if any of this is incoherent nonsense. im feeling a lot of things right now.

ill probably delete this later

&#x200B;

I know that I am selfish for wanting to die, but I dont think ill ever be happy with myself. 

my grandpa ruined me just as my grandpa said. he molested me and my family doesn't even know, but him and my grandma also spoiled me giving me whatever I wanted and letting me eat whatever causing me eating problems. I hate how I look and m appearance, and they dont help at all with me trying to change it and it is hard for me to change too because of how I was raised.

 and I think subconsciously I dont want to look good so my grandpa won't think so either. he always says he wants to see me lose weight before I die and that I should try harder, but when I do he says I look sexy. I hate this house and my appearance. 

I was also SAed by an ex but didn't realize for a while. when I was younger I thought my only value was my sexual appeal, and now my body is ruined, so I subconsciously think I have no value. I have stretch marks and scars, I have hidradenitis suppurativa (however u spell it) and although its a milder kind I have scars. and I have stretch marks and im so unsymmetrical.

 im afraid to never find someone who loves me and I love them. 

the only person who's number one I am is my grandpa, and I hate him. my mom has a husband and kids somewhere else now, and my grandma loves them most. my friends dont really talk to me and have their own best friends.

I know the scars my fade, and I could lose weight and try to get the desired body I want, but the scars will be there. and I will be uneven, I have stretch marks. im just so tired. we are all going to die anyway, and nothing I do here will last. I dont think that I can ever love myself, and I hate living where I do. I want to change and do things but my body and mind won't let me, and the people in my house dont help at all. and even if I did change, there are some things that I cannot change. 

as my uncle says, I am ruined, and I dont know what to do other than die. I just want to love myself and be loved, but at this point I dont think I ever will.

thanks for reading if you did",u/Leather-Bend5813,2,"Thank you for the reply and kind words; I have found it is hard to find understanding people on Reddit at times.

u/Legitimate_Sir_6284,1,"I’ve never been loved by my parents I’m (24m) done with life. I spent the whole day skipping class. Looking up resources for how to get support and feel love. I wasn’t loved by my mother nor father and it’s hard because they do everything for me. Like I’m 24 . No I don’t want them to do it for me. But they don’t support me. I don’t have the motivation to do things when I don’t feel loved. I’ve been depressed ever since I could remember. Suicide seems like my best option because I wouldn’t have to deal with anymore ups and downs. A therapist left me a message today because I had called today asking when I’d be assigned one and it pissed me off that I had to call. It’s been 4 weeks on the waitlist and when I’m down and out now you want to call me. And my parents have the nerve to tell me they’re there for me when they’re the reason I’m so fucked up. Anytime I’ve ever gone to them for help, I’m left feeling worse than before. I feel like a monster because of them, unworthy of anything. I’m just so done with them. And I had to rely on them as a kid, I wanted to run away before. But I had nothing to go to. And I don’t have anything to go to now. I would only work if I had to, not to advance myself. 
I’m left feeling like it’s my fault for even having needs at all",u/Legitimate_Sir_6284,1,"Yeah they took care of me financially too. Its hard to tell the difference, but I was just a tool to get their needs met. Its the same for me, both had significant trauma and justified some of their actions because of the trauma.  

It’s no wonder I would struggle, and now I’m just as bad as them. I have no idea how to form relationships and the ones I do form I struggle with using the same strategies they used on me, making people feel uncomfortable. It made me wonder if my life would have been different if even financially they weren’t taking care of me, if I’d still be around. I don’t think I would be.

Thank you for that.

u/cgreene89,2,"Can’t stop thinking about it. A little background about me before I get into it. I (33M) have been married to my wife (33F) for almost 11 years and have dated her for even longer. We have four kids together. I have been in the military almost nine years now as well. My marriage has been rocky since 2015 when my wife had an affair. Long story short on that, we stayed together but this issue keeps coming up to this day. 

A few months ago I reached out to my doctor about struggling with mental health. I was placed on medications and am currently in therapy. Throughout all this my suicidal thoughts have gotten worse. Everyday I have these thoughts and everyday I remember how a friend in the military committed suicide. I have even gone to the point of writing out letters to my kids in the event I follow through with these thoughts. My medications don’t feel like they are working anymore and since starting them all it has ever done was quiet the thoughts for a little bit.

u/cguthrie013,2,"there's nothing interesting to be said I've been cripplingly depressed since I was 8 years old. I've always been pressed into feeling like I'm evil and selfish for feeling suicidal, even when I'm asking for help. I cut myself, I'm fucking 32 years old, and I cut myself still. I dream of dying. I hope with every will that I will just drop dead, because I'm too much of a coward to follow through with anything. I've tried suicide many times before, with 2 of those attempts landing me in the ER. IDK, maybe my heart isn't in it, or maybe I'm just too much of a little bitch to follow through with any plans at all. I have a husband and 2 children. My son just turned 1 and my daughter is about to turn 9. I love them so very much, but I feel like all I do is draw their lives into more and more turmoil. I try to talk to people about it, but I get shunned and made to feel guilty for feeling the way I do. I tried to share some feelings with my husband this morning and he brought both the kids in to make me look in their face as I say I'm depressed and suicidal. I've tried therapists, but they seem to do nothing but make me feel worse. There also isn't much access to any healthcare at all, let alone mental health. Our only therapist in town would come into the local coffeeshop I worked at and tell her client's business to the front of house staff.

I don't want to leave my kids behind, but I'm beginning to feel so hopeless; like everything I do is just dragging everyone around me down with me. Maybe everyone's life would be better off if I wasn't there to destroy it. I don't believe in God, but maybe there is a reason why I don't get the help I'm asking for. Maybe I'm meant to die.

u/cheesymeowgirl,19,"I wish I didn’t have to think of my son so that I could commit suicide in peace. I just want to end it all. Be free of the pain and depression and anxiety that consumes me every day. I play with him, make him laugh, cuddle him and do the best I can for him as his Mum. I’m like a Zombie moving around doing basic motherly duties whilst dying inside. He’s 3 years old. He knows no differently. 

Everyone says he will be affected or he needs me. He’s 3. He has a great step dad who can afford nice things for him, and a nice step mum who’s been there for him practically since he was 3 months old. He will forget me. He will be able to move on. It won’t be traumatic because he won’t remember. 

As selfish as it sounds the pain and loneliness I feel day to day isn’t worth staying alive for him. I have no friends, no relationship and have to share my son every week practically 50/50 with his perfect family in his own room and his perfect step mum that I can’t stop worrying he will like more than me. I google ways to kill myself every day. I just don’t have the confidence. Every time he’s with me I am prevented from showing emotion and want to stay alive for him, he’s the only thing keeping me alive.

I ask my friends from time to time if they also have thoughts and they say yes...but how do I know if mine are too much. Sometimes mine just feel so real and painful, and it scares me how frequently they can come at times. It further hurts me to even be considering suicide, which just makes me hate myself even more which only makes it worse and makes me more sad.
