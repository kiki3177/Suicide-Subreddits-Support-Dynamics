u/Acceptable_Panic_759,122,"Im 26 and have never experienced what’s it’s like to be loved by someone. Im wondering if I ever will. People say “it’ll come just wait!” But like how long am I supposed to wait… 1/4 of a century isn’t enough waiting? 

I just wanna know what it’s like to be loved and cared for. I want to know what it’s like to be thought about, worried about, or made a little bit of a priority. I want to know what being appreciated feels like. I want to know what being wanted feels like. I give SO much positive light to others but people just come up and use it to heal themselves then leave once they’re better. 

I feel useless or invisible or both. I just want ONE connection in my life that is genuine and my level of love, thought, and care is reciprocated.

I sometimes think my purpose is just to keep helping others, even if they leave afterwards anyway. But I don’t want that purpose or existence. If I could do it without making others sad, I would kill myself immediately. But even tho people consistently hurt me, I never want to hurt anyone.

I’m so stuck and idk how to get out.",u/Acceptable_Panic_759,8,"I mean relationships and friendships.

In 2016 I made an attempt on my life and she cussed me out and called me selfish because she couldn't get my kidney like that. | If I could afford to I would be on a plane tomorrow. | I appreciate you man love you too and wish the best for you | I tried that route but I would need one of her family members to sign a petition to the court to force her to go and they are unwilling | I owe around 160k to fed and 90k to state. I'm not even sure on the banks because most of her loans have been through multiple different places along with her credit cards. Honestly I'm still finding more every day. We don't own the house and are going to be evicted soon. The only things I have to sell are what I make my money with so I'd be shooting myself in the foot if I did and only gain a quarter of what it's all worth. My mom wouldn't pour a shot of water on me if I was on fire. She kicked me out when I turned 17 and refuses to even buy me a burger | If I had a single day go right I'd swear I was in heaven | Well since we're on the same account I can't get off of it unless it's paid off. I haven't made a payment on it in months and started using my business account for everything which is with another bank. But since she has put me so far in debt I can't afford my business insurance or permits and just as my luck goes my truck broke down so I have no transportation other than my classic 1986 model motorcycle. I've talked to an attorney and he told me that I would definitely have to pay alimony because I have been responsible for her quality of living for years | Well sadly I live in the bible belt where the courts are extremely sexist. One of my cousins had the same thing happen to him except his s/o was on heroin. He now pays her 700 every other week, if he misses a payment they issue a warrant on him. Alabama is a real shithole | 7 year marriage. Alimony here is for life | Well now that we can't afford to even eat she has been forced to cut back which you'd think was a good thing except she gets her friends to order her alcohol through door dash. Since her tolerance is lower and she still drinks a 5th in a sitting, I tried to stop her from driving in that condition and in retaliation she beat me with an empty wine jug and left me unconscious in the driveway. | Shit I cut her off lol I'm not attracted to her anymore physically or spiritually. I regularly tell her to find someone else so I can do the same. I may hate her but I've never been one to cheat, honestly I'd rather just be alone at this point | You've done a great job I would have never guessed that it wasn't your first language. Honestly most Americans can't spell or articulate sentences as well as you | To be honest I only have a few years of life left in me if I'm lucky the IRS can eat my ashes for all I care. I'm technically disabled but can't be put on disability because they keep denying me. With my heart failure plus nerve damage from breaking my back twice I can't reliably be an employee but they don't want to hear that noise. 

I've tried everything to get her to work even explaining to her that she's losing me and everything we have. She just says that she's too stressed out or says that she applied to jobs when she really didnt. The only logical assumption I can make is she has another dude as a backup plan when this ship sinks but she's holding on and sucking every penny out of me while she can.

I have zero savings now and can only afford to eat once every 3 days if I'm lucky and it's killing me. I hate to say it but a 9mm looks like an enticing snack every once in a while but I'm holding on as hard as I can hoping that I can find peace in the woods again after I lose all of this | I will look into another attorney, only issue with filing is I would but I literally can't afford to eat. I have $3 in my account and can't get a business loan because my ein isn't old enough and she has ran my credit into the ground so I can't get approved for a personal loan. It seems like no matter which way I turn I'm screwed from every direction | That's what I thought too, apparently since we're married she doesn't need my consent plus on our personal account I was added to it so she has full power to do whatever she wants with it | Nope just 2 cats, 2 dogs and a raccoon | Shit you mean them? No | Yes but they literally laughed at me and told me next time I should duck and dodge. The whole left side of my face was swollen and bruised, they don't care about domestic violence unless it's the woman that gets harmed. | Oh I've made it extremely clear that I want one and she just threatens to self terminate if I do | The sad thing is when we met she wasn't like this, I decided to marry her after I broke my back. If it had been anyone else they would have kicked me to the curb in my wheelchair, when we got married I was covered under her work insurance and got my back fixed. Then I went back to work making around 325 a day, she started getting too used to that and started wasting money and drinking after our 1 year anniversary then turned it into a serious problem/lifestyle. I explained to her years ago that she couldn't continue like that if she wants us to have a future and we'll I guess she didn't believe me. 

She's so damn lazy I doubt she'd even do that, I'm just ready to have her out of my life or to get straightened out for once. | Thank you I'll look into that. Most food banks around here won't help unless you have been approved for EBT | Thanks, I'll look into that. | The cops in my city don't want to do the paperwork. I reported her missing after she got drunk AF and went missing for over a day and they put me in handcuffs to interrogate me over her murder. Then she stumbled out of our shed drunk as fuck asking why the cops were there and they let me go without a single apology. | Oh I told them and they told me that they have to see valid proof of her threatening it. I started recording everything since then but she hasnt had a really bad black out session since. | I understand this more than I'd like to, I have chronic depressive disorder and it has driven me to alcoholism in the past. Luckily I have the strong will to bring myself out of it but even then alcohol makes me happy and gives me the opportunity to reflect on the things I have to be happy about. 

I don't like to argue and keep almost every situation as low key as possible. I don't respond well and shut down even when being yelled at so I choose not to go that route. I'm at the point where I have described the situation and what it entails so many times and different ways that I've come to the conclusion that either she doesn't understand or doesn't care. 

You can only explain that a box is square because it has 4 sides with 4 90° angles so many times before you come to the conclusion that the person wants to believe that a circle is a square so firmly that the facts don't apply. At that point you are wasting effort and energy since factual evidence means nothing to the person who you wish to perceive the message

Personal growth takes effort and it's required to keep ties with your surroundings including the people you want to keep around. I've never read the book you mentioned but I hope I hit somewhere close to the point of it, I'm hypercritical of my own words/actions and how they are perceived by others. | Especially here, they tell me regularly that it's easier to zip up a body bag than to do the paperwork for arrests/crimes even the detectives don't do shit and usually get put on paid leave for selling the drugs that they stole from dealers | She refuses to go to AA, I even tried to get her to go to the hospital to detox and she refused that too. | I learned the ways of dealing with it from my experience with my dad who drank himself to death and she gets extremely aggressive with me when I make the point that she wants to drink and doesn't have to. Anything else is just an excuse, honestly I'm tired of getting hit over it. I told her that when we lose our home we are going in different directions. I'm going back into the woods like when I was a teen and she can go wherever someone will take her. Luckily I know she's too prissy to actually rough it out in the woods with me so I'm not worried about her following me.",1b1l41l,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1b1l41l/my_wife_has_ruined_my_life_and_future/,-0.9994328618049622,-0.9979973435401917,0.0014355182647705078,neutral

I don’t care about my education, I don’t care about getting a job, I don’t care about any future prospects, I don’t care about my health nor care about my life in any capacity whatsoever. I don’t care about relationships.

I can’t bring myself to care about anything in life. 

All I want to do is lay down and do nothing till I pass away. I am sick and tired of everything. I just don’t care at all. 

I never understood how everyone else could find whatever it is they want to do in life and care about it.

Damn | I’m 23, I guess this is a very common mindset to have in our generation, none of us have anything meaningful to live for. Our future has been robbed by climate change and our perpetually increasingly difficult economy.

It is disheartening. | No, I don’t have any friends and I don’t feel anything with my family anymore | I feel you, it sucks hard because you can never fit in with everyone else because of it too. Forever unable to understand their passion for life and trying to achieve the best, whatever that may be | Real. | Same here, I’m never seeing or meeting anyone in my life time, I’m far too unstable to have any sort of relationship with anyone anymore. | From my perspective: I’ve felt this way for as long as I remember, but had none to speak to about this.

I sort of never cared until I witnessed the lives of my online friends over the years changing for the better.

One my friends graduated with a bachelor’s degree and was able to get a good job at a big company, another friend was able to start a business relatively young and it went well for them, one got married to the love of their life and moved in together. Everyone else seemingly able to get their lives together except for me.

That’s when it hit me. I was truly alone. I was stuck with nothing and nobody. I was completely stagnant. I was the only one who had such deep frustration from within towards life. I spent my life in deep isolation and repression and anger that I had realized that I wasted my life wallowing in my own misery unable to care about myself at all. 

I felt jealous. Jealous that they have a desire for life that I never had. I sabotaged my relationships and cut contact with all of them because it brought me so much pain to see them be happy.

That there’s nothing wrong going on and everything was perfectly fine. It made me despair. 

I suppose that’s what made me angry, what made me come out of my usual apathetic uncaring state.

I never cared about myself because I always hated who I am, and was never able to reconcile with myself about that. I became mostly numb about my own life, because I could always take myself out so it didn’t feel so bad.

Its just lonely to see others chase their own happiness while I cannot. I’d feel far less miserable if I could sign my own death warrant immediately than sit around and forever torment myself with the lives of those around me. | I read about that too, but it’s very hard to do especially when you don’t live alone. 

It can take up to a week to be effective which is much too long | I know. Your shrink is an asshole by the way. I hope you stopped seeing him. | We’re failed experiments, not the ideal humans.

Not anymore at least. | What if the spark never ignites?

I don’t really have anything or anyone in my life that matters to me deeply, I don’t remember the last time I was truly happy, I’ve been angry and bitter at the world for as long as I remember. | I don’t have anything like that around and my parents are absolutely against any sort of pets in the house. | I’m sorry to hear about your struggle. You just have to keep it together for your pets, you are their world after all and you can’t abandon them. 

You have to stay alive for them, and who knows.. something good may happen along the way | Religion is part of my problem to be honest. | True | I can’t rely on false hope to be happy. It seems much more cruel to continue on a path that is uncertain for me. 

1. It’s so long ago that I genuinely don’t remember it, but I understand what you mean. 

I would say the only reason I was happy then was because I was a child. I had no responsibility and my view on the world was completely different.

2. How? Because I’m not trying to meet people. I feel utterly detached from everyone around me. Everything feels superficial and especially trying to pretend everything is fine in order to make friends with others is very hard.

3. I genuinely cannot feel anything when I watch those videos. There’s far more cruelty out there happening that it out does the kindness happening  in the video tenfold, I can’t help but be pessimistic about it.

About his life: To be honest it’s pretty fucking miserable, he never takes anything seriously, he has the worst grades possible, he just goes to school to do nothing. I’m also concerned because he has the hobby to completely destroy the school toilet, I know this might seem funny but he literally made the school pay 300k € because he made a flooding in the school and the police are investigating. He also has a problem with porn (again might seem funny but I’m worried) he regularly sends extremely brutal pornography or people having sex with dead animals,he also has the problem that he doesn’t care abt his body att all, idk if he regularly drinks alcohol, but recently he emptied an entire bottle of some liquid (stuff to rinse your mouth) to drunk himself, he apparently puked 3-5 times.

The problem is, that he doesn’t want to talk about it, I mean he kept it a secret for 4 years and regretted telling us immediately.

Divorce and therapy is not in the cards. I just want to rest, no more pressure, no more need to act fine or happy when I’m the farthest thing from it.

Edit1: the way she says things to me I think. She has no love for me, only resentment. She just gets angry when I try to set boundaries. When I tell her that her words are hurting me. When she argues with me and just repeats things over and over and over and I try to explain that I’m emotionally broken and at my limit. When I’ve done something wrong she says I’ve down it 80000 times, she always exaggerates how many time or how often things happen.

u/Organic-Answer496,94,"I was making 100k as an engineer now I’m a broke uber driver Hey guys, I'm feeling pretty down right now and could use a pick me up. It's been a rough day of driving uber and just thinking about how I screwed up my life. I'm 28, and I currently have about 2k in savings. I drive Uber and do part time sales for a gym. I live in a house with 7 other people I barely know. When I was 24, I had about 50k in savings and was working at a big time bank as a software engineer making a little over 100k a year. I used to live in a penthouse apartment with 2 close roommates. But after the pandemic, I felt unfulfilled by the work and quit my job to pursue my passions. I ended up going down a rabbit hole of business ventures that ended up draining all my money and getting 12k of credit card debt. Very stupid I know. I did pull off some cool stuff and learned I have a passion for sales and marketing but for the most part Ive been feeling lost ever since and the only things that keep me going is working out and training MMA, which is how I ended up doing sales at a gym. The job market is really bad for software engineers and even then, I'm not 100% sure if I want to return to the profession as it still feels unfulfilling. Sales is fun for me but it's not enough shifts so I have to Uber to pay the rest of my bills. Because of that, this whole day I've been driving around professionals going in and out of their jobs and just been feeling like a failure all day. I plan on finding more sales work but currently I'm barely making ends meet to pay my bills and honestly feel like I have no value. I get really down thinking I may never have what I once had or find even a comfortable place financially. And it makes me feel stupider for doing what I did. I know 28 is young but the idea that I'll soon be 30 and be still struggling financially scares and depresses me.

u/TheRealGarbanzo,191,"I Think I Just Experienced How Dangerous Depression is and How Much Trouble I May Be in Last night, something happened. I took a walk to calm down and that's when I made a mistake.

I got high during this walk and went to the nearby train station to sit down for a while

Before I left I was having very bad thoughts. Thinking about how much easier things would be if I was just dead

An express Amtrak train was coming through the station. I didn't know it was an express train so I stood relatively close to the track (on the platform) so I could experience the train going by

The train that actually came, came by fast. It rumbled the ground, was loud. It honestly scared me as it flew past, the suction from the last few cars even moved me around slightly 

After this, I went to Wendy's and there I think I was able to uncover the real reason I feel the way I do. I have no direction in life. I feel like a failure already in my early 20s. I just dont see a future in which I'm happy

I'm sorry if this next part doesn't make sense
I'm trying to remember how I felt last night, laying down. I was scared, I never felt such a terror at the thought of what could be happening to me.

I felt like there's two different personalities in me and one of them is okay with dying and the other really isn't. And the one that really isn't okay with dying is being suppressed normally. But last night I think I felt it. The terror of knowing that there could be this thing inside me, alerting the way I think against my will. Making me think that suicide is the answer 

I'm not sure why I went to the station. I didn't have any intentions to do anything. But I wondered, ""what if I was feeling worse?"" If what I experienced isn't just from me being high, could whatever is making me think this way really win one day?

I know this didn't really make sense but I'm having trouble finding the words to describe what happened..

I just wanna ask, has any one you experienced something like this?",u/TheRealGarbanzo,32,"I'm glad you're still here | That does make sense | Sort of yeah. I was in control. But I can't help but feel like if I was in a worse state of mind. What would've happened

I know that my feelings were being amplified (definitely not getting high while feeling bad again)

But it was unlike anything I've ever experienced before. It's like a part of me opened up that was previously locked away | Absolutely. Thats exactly how it feels | Hopefully.

I do know that people say this (I mean, cheat days are a thing for a reason). But, after the first couple of months I didn't really need one save for every couple months or so.

u/jeonkoo_,81,"i'm 18 and suicidal as i sit here crying in my bed as usual, i've decided to finally reach out to someone just anyone who could possibly see or aknowledge that i'm alive and that i'm also on this planet. I feel incredibly lonely, i have no friends, i don't go to school, i don't work, i don't leave the house. No one knows i exist.

I left my home-country together with my family 3 years ago and left everything behind hoping and wishing for a better life. I didn't have the best lifestyle or a huge group of friends, but i had friends i had school and i had freedom, i had a life. I was happy. I never thought i would end up like this or spend my days taking care of my family and my younger brothers waking up to cleaning all day long to cooking and putting my brothers to sleep. My father is abusive and extremly controlling, i can't leave the house or use my phone during nights etc. the only times i'm allowed to leave the house is when i have to follow him to the grocery store to help with the groceries. I'm not allowed to have social medias or stay in my room for too long. just small details i think anyone would find normal and not weird or ""wrong"". i'm tired of being controlled, i can't decide when i want to shower or when i want to do anything on my own. i used to love art, but i have no time for it anymore. I have no time for my self and there is no point in life.

I ended up in hospital a few months ago when i cut my self pretty deep 3 times in hope that it would frighten or bring any type of attention from my parents but everything is back to normal. I still hurt and cut myself but i know i have to do it somewhere they wouldn't be able to notice otherwise i'm pretty sure they would be very mad and hurt. I used to be very good in school and had so many A's, my dream was to work as a therapist... which is kind of ironic now that i'm searching for one..

i have one friend left that i used to be friends with back in my homecountry, she is my best friend and my only hope in life even though shes depressed as well. She's been starting to go to school more and has more friends and i'm scared that she's going to leave me. She has been getting a bit more distant from me and is usually pretty quiet and busy during calls. i feel so mentally abused by my father, i'm stressed 24/7 and especially around him.

u/pureparedo,413,"anhedonia is a cruel joke Anhedonia is a symptom of depression, the lack or reduced ability to feel pleasure. I think it's the worse part of depression, we all experience sadness at some point, but when coping mechanism don't work how can someone realistically function in society. Is the entirety of adult life just coping or is that just the people like me. I couldn't imagine growing old and feeling this way.

Some people say they love life and are rarely depressed. The last time I felt thay way I was a child. I haven't felt like that for at least 7 years. I really do think I'm screwed. When you have depression for a while it really becomes painful. The anxiety too. I don't function like a healthy person. I'm always tired. Even when I'm thinking of nothing. I feel empty. I think much of it comes from childhood neglect. I don't think I'll ever feel safe or loved. I don't even know what it feels like. Being  around people gives me anxiety. 

When I try to be a normal person with healthy habits. I have mental breakdowns. Doing anything consistently even eating or sleeping normally is so tiring. If I do one productive thing, I'm drained. I feel nauseous often lately.

u/throwaway8464729205,118,"What's the fucking point of being alive when life is nothing but pain? Throwaway because people at my law school know my main and I might actually unlive myself if they see this. 
On paper, I have a lot going for me. Succeeded in my dream of going to law school, have a house that is paid off, conventionally attractive (I'm past the point of social mores right now, don't worry, I'm humbled by my overwhelming sense of self hatred) Objectively, my life looks pretty good and I've reliably achieved almost everything I've gone after. 

That being said, being alive has become unbearable. I feel nothing and everything at the same time. I can't connect with people anymore. I'm terrified of every social interaction, and I've been taught through experience that I am not worthy of love in the eyes of others. 

I think that realizing this is what did me in. Around 5-7 years ago, I was consumed by depression and anxiety. I didn't feel worthy of existing, and even now I couldn't tell you why. I just couldn't see my own worth. Eventually, I drug myself out of the pit through a lot of introspection and personal work. I became the person I always wanted to be. I thrived, and it got me to where I am now. I found self-worth, which is something that I'd never experienced before 

Over the last year, things have declined and I'm in a darker place than I've ever been. I actually can't see the point of living anymore. I have gone through emotional hell over the last 3 years. For a while, I was able to compartmentalize. Now, that seems impossible, because how the fuck am I supposed to compartmentalize my feelings of worthlessness when literally almost every person in my life has given me every reason to believe I'm not worthy of love or even respect. 

It isn't in my head. I grew up with a father that, from the time I was 6, ntentionally brainwashed me into believing that my mother (who had primary custody) didn't love me and never wanted me. His entire side of the family helped perpetuate this. He also gave me nothing but conditional love while instilling in me that I'll never be enough for any number of reasons. 

Then, I spent my adolescence being goomed by a grown man under the guise of love. He then used that love to buy my silence as he helped himself to my body and then offered what was left of me to his friends. This is just the worst of it. Not to mention the constant cycle of cheating and leaving, just to come back to do it again. Enter substance abuse. 

Eventually, I got away from him. Met someone who treated me like I walked on water. He wasn't perfect, but he also got the worst, most unhealed version of me and it showed. I'm still not sure that I didn't deserve what he did to me in the end. In retrospect, I think I broke him too. Regardless, after 3.5 years he cheated on me with his ex, told me he didn't love me anymore, and left. Then he came back and spent the next six months using the immense love that I, regardless of my failings, felt for him to get laid while he found his current wife. 

I broke, but it allowed me to put myself back together again, better than I'd ever been before. Who I'd always wanted to be. I told myself that it was okay because it motivated me to become a kinder, healthier, more complete version of myself. 

Then I met the person who I credit with destroying that. He convinced me I could be vulnerable with him. I shared every part of myself, the darkest parts, because he made me feel like I was safe. Until he proved I wasn't. Year one, he turned my trauma into a weapon, oscillating between telling me that I was the most amazing person he'd ever met and punishing me for all of my failings as a human being in his eyes. Year two, I learned that he actually had a girlfriend and an engagement ring to give her the whole time. Year three, he's made it clear that I no longer matter to him. The more he hurt me, the harder I loved him, and I still wasn't enough. And in the end, when I told him how he had broken me, all he had to say was ""Haha sorry"". 

Add in a year of realizing that some of my closest friendships came from the fact that I was around and required nothing from them, and that the second I did, they had no use for me anymore. 

Now I'm alone. I have no one. 

I give and I give and I fucking GIVE. I bend over backwards to show the people in my life that I'd do anything for them, just to be shown that I'll never be good enough for anyone no matter what I do. 

Please don't tell me that it's going to be okay and I'll find my people. I'm almost 27. My life has been nothing but a cycle of everyone I let near me picking my bones clean until I have nothing left to offer them. Then they leave. Everyone leaves. 

I can't even take comfort in the idea that I'll have the human connections that I've been chasing my entire life because even if I do, I've been taught to expect nothing but pain in the end. Why would I seek something out that has never done anything but erode me down to a shell of a person. 

It isn't that I want to die. I just don't know how to convince myself to keep living. I'm empty inside. The only thing I feel is emotional pain so strong that I can't remember the last time that my chest didn't physically hurt. What's the point of any of this? Why would should I keep going when    all I've ever known is abuse that called itself love? 

Why would I fix myself if it's just so someone can come along and break me again? What is the point of believing I have value if no one else sees it.

I don't want to die, but death feels like a reprieve at this point. I just want someone to love me. Why is that too much to ask? ",u/throwaway8464729205,2,"I'm medicated.

Although, I didn't do nothing. I went to therapy for 4 years. I have had 7 years of social interaction since then. Socializing did not get any easier. At this point I would rather die than keep trying to improve.

Also saying ""it gets better"" implies that time is the only factor in improving. I've had 7 years and voluntary attempts on my end and it in fact has not gotten better.

Commenter, when does it get better then?",1gm4zpx,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1gm4zpx/they_always_say_it_gets_better_its_been_2552_days/,-0.9972732663154602,-0.9833126664161682,0.013960599899291992,neutral
u/throwawayls0622,1247,"Everyone says if you're depressed, don't be afraid to reach out and ask for support... Well, we try to. And guess what? No one cares. Everyone is busy with their own lives and problems. They don't want to hear about how you're severely depressed and think about killing yourself every day. It makes them uncomfortable. So in your hopes to receive some sort of support or connection, you just end up pushing people away, which makes you even more isolated and depressed. That is all.

I'm my own worst enemy"" | Honestly, same... | Hanging in there, thank you for asking. ❤️

I told my husband I was severely depressed and his response was ""okay"". 

So I'm trying to make these little pumpkins out of pipe cleaners to not think about unaliving myself. 

How are you doing? | That's good! I'm proud of you for reaching out and I appreciate it. Been trying to do the same. | Haha I love that you asked about that. It's so fun and easy!

u/throwout7642356937,282,"This just isn’t it man. That’s it, that’s the post, I’ve lived the same way in my head with the same “routine” and way of thinking with the same problems and I’m tired. 

That probably made no sense but it makes sense to me.

Being in college has only made these problems worse, I hate the assignments, I hate the stress and worry, I hate the pressure to “power through it” from family members otherwise “you’ll work in a factory for the rest of your life” or whatever bullshit that I’ve been told my entire life.

So here I am, “powering through it”, now with passive suicidal ideation on top of depression and severe anxiety.

This isn’t it man, it can’t be, this isn’t what being alive is. I’m tired of it all.",u/throwout7642356937,24,"My dad gets mad when I say I want to drop out of college because “you’ll do factory work for the rest of your life” and “you’ll be begging to go back after a month”.

And after a lecture, it’s “but hey, it’s your decision”.

I feel like suicide would happen sooner.",1fomyv7,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1fomyv7/this_just_isnt_it_man/,-0.948418378829956,-0.9933387637138367,-0.044920384883880615,neutral
