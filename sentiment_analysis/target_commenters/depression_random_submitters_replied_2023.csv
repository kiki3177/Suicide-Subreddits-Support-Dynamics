Its hard to express emotion, hard to find joy in doing most things, I have a very small attention spand, and forget things easily. It makes it hard to date, or be around family because I'm such a bummer and I guess people seem to think I have no interest.

I’ve been grieving on and off for quite some time and dealing with childhood trauma and his absence growing up while also accepting his death. I paid for his funeral all by myself and shortly after 2 other family members died the same day a few weeks later. 

On top of that we found out my mom (never smoked or drink) has serious small tumor in her head, causing her to need treatment. 

Im scared, sad, worried, etc. I love my mom and it hurts to see her in pain and sad. I don’t want to lose her, especially after my losing dad. I’m afraid of being alone in this world. 

I’ve been walking around smiling but deep inside I’m miserable and stressed.

First of all he’s so nice to all my other siblings but when it comes to me he always has something negative to say. He calls me fat and then says it’s a joke. Today I had to do homework and he said before the wedding he would explain everything, he kept reminding me before. The homework hw was for the end of the day but kept nagging me in the morning. When I tried to do it and asked him to send the screenshots of the homework or open it because I was using his zoom, he said I left everything on the last minute and didn’t even bother to help me. After the hurtful shit he says he leaves the house, knowing damn well I’m crying but doesn’t give a shit. He always sounds so frustrated with me. Keep in mind he’s always been picking on me. He always threatens to slap me even though the last time he did it he made me bleed then asked for forgiveness, but he didn’t care if I were hurt clearly he just didn’t want to go to jail. When my sisters are on their phone he does nothing but when I’m on my phone he gets so pissed for like no reason. He also keeps trying to choose my career path. I originally really want to become a K-pop idol but he’s forcing me into religious studies. He barely spends any time with me and when he comes back home there’s always arguments. He also always compares me to my cousins and talks about how I never talk with them. He always tells me why I’m different. One time had a whole lecture at me. It wasn’t any normal lecture he said really hurtful stuff. I cried during the middle of it but he just left me and threatened to slap me if I didn’t tell him what happened. Also he’s forcing me to go boxing even though I made the decision I didn’t like it. He made me leave but then for some reason he forced me to carry on because my cousins were doing it. Me clearly not being happy with the decision was sad but he didn’t give a shit. I wanted to do karate instead.

u/Sapphire2408,1,"Best work-model for people with mental illnesses? While I wouldn't say I have depression anymore (I think i handles it with SSRI's and a successful therapy), I still have severe body dysmorphia, which, just like depression, makes my days hell sometimes. Sometimes I get up and just don't want to go to work, because I feel so ugly and I know, the day is gonna be misery and make the situation worse. Staying home would be great then.

Right now, I work fully remote as a software engineer. My mental health is great because of that, but I really notice my social life is not what is could be. I never go out because my colleagues are just so distant. They work from all over the state and it's just too far for building relationships.

There are hybrid models too, like working from home 2 days a week and going to the office 3 days a week, but I feel like that wouldn't make the social aspect that much better as not all colleagues will be at work when you are.

&amp;#x200B;

Whats your opinion on that?",u/Sapphire2408,1,"I completely agree. However, I feel like all work models have their pros and cons. Working fully remote definitely makes me worry less and reduces anxiety. Going to the office full time makes me more social and feel more integrated at the cost of feeling shitty way more often. Also, it's better for my health, as I move WAY more then. Actually, since Covid, I gained over 20 pounds just because I don't go to work anymore and work from home instead.

I'm planning on changing companies soon that's why I'm wondering which model works best, but all of them seem to be kind of shitty.

Recently, I had some triggers (reading about doctors  on reddit denigrating Physician Assistants, which I am, which sent me into a OCD spiral questioning who I am and my purpose). So for the past week, I have been extremely high anxiety.

I restarted my celexa out of desperation.

I have never taken an IQ test, but I know for sure I am above average. I have been reading that high IQ people have trouble with marriage and depression.

And now im worried that if celexa is keeping me afloat, what if it stops working? I'll be stranded

Reading about this stuff makes me feel like I am cursed and now I am reading that depression is progressive and it has me really worrying since I have had trouble with relationships in the past (32 and single) due to OCD.

u/Saulgoodmafagga,2,"I wouldn't read this, it's a total bummer. Hey everyone. I'm not sure exactly what I expect from this. No offense, but I doubt a bunch of depressed people can offer much to turn around my own depression. But I don't know, I need something, man. My depression has such a deep hold of me right now. For a long time, it's like you don't even know it's there. Maybe you just had a bad day. Or a couple of bad days in a row. And then you realize it's been like this for almost two years now. At least that's what it's like for me at the moment.

I'm still trying, you know, sorta. I still have hope that things might get better, eventually. But I'm having trouble just getting out of bed in the morning. I live in Norway, so there's like four hours of daylight during the winter, and I'm missing all of them, and it's freezing outside.

I watched this youtube video yesterday because I wondered if there was some link to depression and memory loss. Turns out there is. I ended up watching another one, which was like a ten symptoms of depression kinda thing. I had every one them. I'm not eating well. I'm not sleeping well. I forget things constantly. I can't focus on anything for longer than a few minutes. I skip fifteen seconds at a time, fifteen seconds, fifteen seconds, fifteen seconds, through movies on Netflix because I get too bored to even pay attention. I skip to end like, just tell me what happens, it doesn't matter. 

I quit my job about two months back. They told they would have to fire me if I didn't quit on my own. It was the first job I've had based on my education. I just couldn't do it. No matter how much I tried. I would forget stuff constantly. It's like my brain refused to learn. I made so many mistakes. My boss even asked me if I had some type of learning disability she needed to know about. Anyway, the quality of the work just wouldn't improve and I eventually figured it would be better to tell my next employer that I had quit, rather than that I got fired.

Now I'm living off my last paycheck, staying at my mom's place. I haven't applied for a single job. Not one. I'm lying to people, my girlfriend included, and telling them that I have. But I'm just so down, all of the time. The things that used to excite me no longer do. Music sounds annoying, unless it's slow and sad and without vocals. I can't get through even four pages of a book. I'm not writing. None of my ideas interest me anymore. I go outside and I just have nowhere to go. The world seems like a cold, boring shopping mall, not selling anything that I want. My friends are all busy. Having jobs and lives. 

I can't find anything that I want to do. Except drugs I guess. But I don't do them. I know they'll only make things worse, there's no point. I just want to snap out of this and be something close to happy again. But I can't find any direction in life I want to go. I look for jobs online(occasionally) and they're all like ""Hey! Do you fucking love our corporate culture? Well even if you don't, you'll have to pretend to! Come help us expand our markedplace into new and exciting territories of paperclip insurance! We offer competitive salary options, meaning you'll barely scrape by each month. And you can piss your life away in our depressing office building while you're at it!"".

Sorry. I know that's not helping. It's just the way I feel. Like I'm getting absolutely fucked by life. And like I'm totally powerless to do anything about it. At this point I'm actually considering just moving into the woods and building a log cabin. Just to get away from everything.

Words of encouragement and support have a bad aftertaste for me these days. But if you have any thoughts for me, I guess I'll read them. Might be some good content in there. I suppose I'd even be grateful, somewhere inside.

All my life I was a man of nothing, from a poor family, with poor academic performance and few friends. In adolescence, everything changed drastically, I completely withdrew into myself and began to think about suicide almost every day. I have always had problems with my teeth, and until now it spoils the appearance of a fairly young person, and at the age of 17 my hair began to fall out, at the moment I have a huge bald spot. I completed my secondary education as a programmer, worked for 2 months and joined the army (this is mandatory in my country). And now, for 7 months now, I have been free, I can’t find a job as a programmer, and I’m not sure that I can handle it if something happens, my mother works alone, and it’s more and more difficult for me morally to do this with her, but also to work in positions other than a programmer I don't want. It also sometimes hits me very hard that by the age of 23, I have never had any relationships, and I’m not an incel at all, I just can’t meet the needs and give the girls what they need. I'm very obnoxious in person, and I can't control my jokes. Thoughts of suicide never leave me, but they are more like another bad thought that will never leave me until I commit suicide. I got desperate and started googling articles on how to become normal, like what guides are there on how to be a normal person.

When she told me to leave after I didn’t take the break up well in 2020 she told  me “ I would rather get back with the guy I cheated on with you or the guy I dumped after you than ever consider talking to you again” that really fucked me up, and to this day I don’t even approach girls because why would I want to waste their time. 

I’m sure she’s working on her masters or phd and the dude she was with seemed so well put together. Meanwhile here I am jobless struggling to do good in life. I feel like a failure.",u/SayJose,2,"I feel stupid about it no doubt. It might also be because I haven’t found any connection since even when I was trying. I’m sure there is something super dysfunctional going on, but after seeing her, how good and happy she looked and she never once struggled to find someone new to connect with.

I just don’t feel like I’ll ever matter to anyone and the older I get the further downhill it’s going. I’m so anxious right now and the depression is really doing it’s thing today",1349p9o,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1349p9o/im29m_just_sad_i_guess/

u/ScratchBurner109z,1,"I don’t want to be here (but not in a suicidal way / trigger warning) No big revelation, and I promise y’all I am not suicidal. If I was I would go seek help, and anyone reading this who may be feeling like ending it I implore you to find a professional and speak about these those feelings. I think where I am coming from is more of a place of ideation than action and I’m here to unpack and hopefully understand. 

Anywho, I know a lot of us suffer with mental health issues and have the feeling of just don’t want to be here anymore. I want to open this conversation because I know many more of us quietly think this, but don’t speak about it. 

Life isn’t always particularly dark. There is beauty and fortune in the chaos. I personally have good health, and my family. Live in a country with lot of opportunities. Most things are quite good considering and I’m grateful for this. My biggest personal “problem” is that I’m poor but but I am at least educated and capable to change this, Which is a privilege. I’m just dealing with depression now and yea is what it is. 

But I honestly wonder what it all means. I’m spiritual and believe in god. I’ve traveled and explored many religions. I’m extremely Open minded and the vastness of the universe seems greater and greater every time I sit back and think about it. And it makes me truly wonder, what is even the point of it all? Why are we here and do the things we drive ourselves crazy to do/don’t do actually even matter? Sometimes I would just like to vaporize (without dying or anything tragic, In a way with no grief an that nobody will miss me lol) and just turn into light or whatever ethereal form we turn into once this phyysical form shuts down - So I’m not really longing to end this life, but I have a deep longing in the pit of my stomach and the seat of my heart for whatever comes next. And so much of that longing is coupled with wanderlust. While at the same time, how can you lust and king after something you can’t even conceptualize? 

Anyone out there feel me? Thoughts?",u/ScratchBurner109z,1,"Haha man thank you so much. I laughed so hard at that first line you wrote. Yea, literally nobody gave a fooook 🤣🤣 - It’s okay through.

u/ScrtlyDprssdAndAnxs,2,"I just realized how f'ed up my life is. I'm the kind of person who smiles and sees the good in everything, but lately, life has been slapping me constantly in the face. I see no meaning in life, I see no purpose, been thinking that way, way before, but I always try to stay strong and continue. But I've fallen so deep, and I feel like I'm falling deeper and deeper. 

Ever since I was young, I always feel so alone. Broken family, raised by a single mother who went abroad when I was 6, youngest with 10 years gap and has no role model in life as all my siblings are drop outs, all the pressure is on me. I always felt this gap with my family as if I was not a part of it. They always say I am loved, but I feel nothing. I feel more of as a burden, nothing but a responsibility, and an invested person to help them get up. I honestly want to end it all at the moment. I've always been thinking about it but was strong enough to control myself, but now I feel like there is nothing to stop it anymore. Just by the fact that I'm writing all this as a last resort, to at least get it out of my system is so new to me, and is already a sign that I gave up.   
I had and is still having a hard time socializing with people, but I do have people I call friends and best of friends, and with the mask I portray, I've become someone seen as a friendly person. I also had lovers before, they were someone who gave light to me, at least a piece of hope to continue at least a bit longer, but at the end of the day, it's always me who gives pure strength to myself, as they do come and go. They have their own lives to live. I've been enough of a burden.   


I know that I need help. I seek for help with my friends, but the fact that they have their own lives to live, makes me hesitate to just rely on them fully at the moment, at least until I'm fine to walk with my own feet again. I'm also planning on at least asking for help on our counselor, because I'm really afraid  of what I'm capable of doing as of the moment.

I kept hanging around the guy, so OF COURSE something was going to happen again. He deserves so much better than someone who lies.

This makes it sound bad, but it was during a really rough patch. I was being an idiot and somehow he stuck with me.

u/ScuroSqualo,1,"My life is objectively good: so why am I always feeling negative? I want to start by explaining my situation a little. I (28M) am living in a rented apartment with my partner, in which we have enough money for rent, groceries, dates, travelling and, to a lesser degree, hobbies. And even after all that, we can still save enough money in a month for a house.

We both have respectable jobs and higher education, and I also have loving parents and an extremely supportive older brother who's always there for me. I have some very good friends that I get to hang out with at times and have at least a couple of laughs every day. However, I also experienced some form of mistreatment as a child (abuse, bullying, anxious attachment issues), so this might tip the scales in the opposite direction in one way or another.

Nevertheless, I feel like everytime something mildly bad happens at work or I fail another attempt at quitting one of my addictions, which are emotional eating & smoking, I fall into this ""pit of despair"" that makes me even more lethargic and miserable than I already was on the inside.

I feel like everytime something bad happens I reaffirm to myself that I'm both a failure and hugely unlucky in life, and that it would probably be much easier to ""quit life"" than continue because ""I'm clearly not made for this world"".

I know it sounds stupid and illogical, I've been going to therapy to sort it out, but haven't seen much progress yet. I don't know if it's because I've grown to become so overly pessimistic or that I have the wrong mindset to improve, but if there's one thing that i can say about me, it's that i do keep trying to improve, both for myself and my partner.

What else can i do to improve my mental situation? I just want to break the cycle of ""See? Told you that life sucks!"" and make the most of every day instead. Do I simply have depression, or could there be another cause?

Note: please don't suggest medication, I already know that route exists and will consider it if all else fails.
