I \[24M\] have been passively suicidal for a few months now, but yesterday was an exceptionally awful day. I slept super late, I forgot I was scheduled to work, couldn't get dressed, couldn't leave the house, tried to fix my bike but ended up breaking it even more. Then I gave into pretty much all of my self-sabotaging vices (drugs, porn, shitty food, video games, you name it). 

  
I swear something snapped. I cried a *ridiculous* amount throughout the day and spent the rest of the night feverishly reading up on suicide. I actually figured out my gameplan. I found a whole document outlining the specifics and answered all the little questions I had (sorry not sharing — don't even ask me) plus a backup option in case I'm desperate enough to do something quicker. For now, I'm in the stage of acquiring the materials and getting my affairs in order.

  
Since I got my suicide method figured out, I'm in a strangely upbeat mood. 

It's an odd paradox. Finalizing my plan of action to end my life made me feel motivated to go out and live it. I'm getting chores done with no sweat, I'm dancing and listening to fun music, I'm gaining bits of my personality back. A great weight has been lifted off my shoulders.

From what I heard, it's common for people to act calm or joyful the days before they make an attempt. Is that what I'm experiencing? Maybe it's because I have a goal now? Like my days don't feel meaningless like they persistently have? Or maybe finally there's an escape route to break free from the shitshow that is my life. I don't feel as trapped and hopeless anymore. 

Anyways, I wanted to see if this anyone here had a similar experience or wants to weigh in on this situation.

TL:DR - I'm actively suicidal for the first time in my life and I feel much better after I figured out my method. What's the meaning behind this?

u/Plutosunrise,u/Plutosunrise,"Teen daughter tried to commit suicide. Found her suicide note today Throwaway account.  Daughter(14) tried to commit suicide Sunday night by taking a lethal dose of Tylenol and Advil.  Luckily school has been hitting the suicide hot line pretty hard with the students and she texted them before and after taking the pills.  They were able to convince her to give up our address.  Wife and I were home and had no idea until a frantic police man came up to the door.  Long story short, she survived with no permanent damage.  She started inpatient care yesterday.  We went thru her phone and the texts to the hot line indicate she has been having these feelings for two years.  We started going thru her room today and found her note.  It was addressed to her best friend and didn't even mention my wife and I.  That was a gut punch.  This was so out of the blue.  She is such a great kid.  Fantastic grades, lots of friends, very well liked at school, and highly empathetic towards others.  In her texts to the hot line, she was guilt ridden on how good her life was.  She couldn't understand why her life was so good when many others around her struggle with single parents, bad parents, poor, etc while she seems to have it all.  This is tearing me up.  We meet with the social worker tomorrow.  I assume family sessions will occur at some point.  She is on fall break this week, so her absence from school won't be noticed, but if she is out when school starts back up next week it is going to be harder and harder to explain.  I want her to stay as long as needed inpatient, but I'm scared how cruel teenagers can be if it gets out at school.  How do you manage all of this?",Her close friends are great.  One already knows and has talked to her on the phone.  It is the rest of the school I'm worried about.,2,1,1,"[0.58873063 0.0017104  0.00178577 0.00465422 0.03582983 0.0772685

u/Plutosunrise,u/Plutosunrise,"Teen daughter tried to commit suicide. Found her suicide note today Throwaway account.  Daughter(14) tried to commit suicide Sunday night by taking a lethal dose of Tylenol and Advil.  Luckily school has been hitting the suicide hot line pretty hard with the students and she texted them before and after taking the pills.  They were able to convince her to give up our address.  Wife and I were home and had no idea until a frantic police man came up to the door.  Long story short, she survived with no permanent damage.  She started inpatient care yesterday.  We went thru her phone and the texts to the hot line indicate she has been having these feelings for two years.  We started going thru her room today and found her note.  It was addressed to her best friend and didn't even mention my wife and I.  That was a gut punch.  This was so out of the blue.  She is such a great kid.  Fantastic grades, lots of friends, very well liked at school, and highly empathetic towards others.  In her texts to the hot line, she was guilt ridden on how good her life was.  She couldn't understand why her life was so good when many others around her struggle with single parents, bad parents, poor, etc while she seems to have it all.  This is tearing me up.  We meet with the social worker tomorrow.  I assume family sessions will occur at some point.  She is on fall break this week, so her absence from school won't be noticed, but if she is out when school starts back up next week it is going to be harder and harder to explain.  I want her to stay as long as needed inpatient, but I'm scared how cruel teenagers can be if it gets out at school.  How do you manage all of this?",My wife and I have talked about that as one possible way to help her understand that being well off gives you the ability to help others in need so it doesn't have to be a bad thing.  Will bring that up with her doctors/therapist.,2,2,2,"[3.66311264e-03 2.84844311e-04 4.99271031e-04 2.23316252e-03

It's got a big field way on the outskirts of it. Peaceful, with a good view of the stars too. I plan on waiting until everyone goes to sleep tonight, take my last shower at about 10 pm, and write 2 more on-paper notes. One for my family to find in my room, telling them to call the police and telling them the location of my body, and one on my body telling the police that my suicide letter is on my phone in my notes app. I'll walk to the park somewhere between 12 - 3 am and just look at the stars for a while. Might drink a little too, play some music. Once I've said my prayers and my last words, turn my gun onto myself, pull the trigger, and see what happens from there. These past few days have been strangely peaceful actually. Feels like I've got control of my life for once and that I actually know what's gonna happen.

u/fullofselfhatred,u/fullofselfhatred,"Last day on Earth. This is an update to my [last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/depressed/s/aJfYvgCwJf)

Today's the day, and tonight's the night. I don't really have anything planned for today really, just do the chores my parents gave me, proofread my letter one more time, and just pass the time with video games and YouTube until tonight. I've already scouted out where I want to do it. Not at my house since I don't want to scar my family any more than what they're already gonna be from this. I plan on doing it at my local park. It's got a big field way on the outskirts of it. Peaceful, with a good view of the stars too. I plan on waiting until everyone goes to sleep tonight, take my last shower at about 10 pm, and write 2 more on-paper notes. One for my family to find in my room, telling them to call the police and telling them the location of my body, and one on my body telling the police that my suicide letter is on my phone in my notes app. I'll walk to the park somewhere between 12 - 3 am and just look at the stars for a while. Might drink a little too, play some music. Once I've said my prayers and my last words, turn my gun onto myself, pull the trigger, and see what happens from there. These past few days have been strangely peaceful actually. Feels like I've got control of my life for once and that I actually know what's gonna happen.

I'd like to thank everybody who left comments or sent me pms after my last post. All of you are amazing people and you will hopefully go on to do great things with your lives. Thank you for giving some comfort in my final days. 🖤

If I somehow survive or the gun jams I'll give you guys another update, but this is most likely gonna be my last post. Farewell everyone.

u/fullofselfhatred,u/fullofselfhatred,"Last day on Earth. This is an update to my [last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/depressed/s/aJfYvgCwJf)

Today's the day, and tonight's the night. I don't really have anything planned for today really, just do the chores my parents gave me, proofread my letter one more time, and just pass the time with video games and YouTube until tonight. I've already scouted out where I want to do it. Not at my house since I don't want to scar my family any more than what they're already gonna be from this. I plan on doing it at my local park. It's got a big field way on the outskirts of it. Peaceful, with a good view of the stars too. I plan on waiting until everyone goes to sleep tonight, take my last shower at about 10 pm, and write 2 more on-paper notes. One for my family to find in my room, telling them to call the police and telling them the location of my body, and one on my body telling the police that my suicide letter is on my phone in my notes app. I'll walk to the park somewhere between 12 - 3 am and just look at the stars for a while. Might drink a little too, play some music. Once I've said my prayers and my last words, turn my gun onto myself, pull the trigger, and see what happens from there. These past few days have been strangely peaceful actually. Feels like I've got control of my life for once and that I actually know what's gonna happen.

I'd like to thank everybody who left comments or sent me pms after my last post. All of you are amazing people and you will hopefully go on to do great things with your lives. Thank you for giving some comfort in my final days. 🖤

If I somehow survive or the gun jams I'll give you guys another update, but this is most likely gonna be my last post. Farewell everyone.

It also helps that the University is 2 hours away from my home so I actually rent near it. I go home every weekend thinking ""do they know already?"". I know a lot about my field as I practice it every now and then by working with a licensed engineer. I don't make a lot of money from it though but the things I learned that is connected to the degree program is what kept me from blanking when asked by my family about my academic life.

I have run out of time. The graduation from the University is 10 days away and everyone thinks I am graduating. And I am somewhat happy, that I can finally end my life. I have been such a big disappointment for my parents. I am their only child. I cry everytime I imagine what my mom would feel after I do it. My girlfriend, who by the way also doesn't know anything broke up with me yesterday, which makes the goodbye part of it all very hard. I have planned everything out already, from what i'll use to when and where. I just wanted to vent some of the heaviness from my chest. I feel so sad about my parents and my (ex) girlfriend. I am gonna start writing my suicide letters tomorrow. Thank you guys.","Hey man, i am so sorry yoi are in that situation too, but you deserbe to live.

I often am in your shoes in these times. Last night I felt a little more desperate than usual so I posted, but I truly didn’t expect anyone to respond…. Everyone was so nice to me I literally didn’t know what to do. I figure responding to them all would be best. 

I mean had I only gotten a single comment I would’ve felt better, I would’ve listened to them. But now all these people care? Holy shit. Idk if you’ve ever seen the Grinch movie but in it his heart grows bigger in size - that’s how I feel from all these comments. And you have no idea how grateful I am that you are also benefitting from this post 😭

Idk if it’s against the rules here, but anyone here can hit me up and we can be friends? I don’t have a lot of friends so idk how to really do this lol… but yeah.

I know it sounds stupid but can someone just tell me not to leave the house? Like we don’t even have to talk or anything.

I want someone to take the blame for being the reason I stay home instead.

I mean, I have depression and everything, but it’s usually manageable. You all helped so much. I feel like absolute shit for having wasted everyone’s time like this, but also I know a bunch of you are telling me I didn’t waste anyone’s time… idk, I’m just confused. I’m still tired, but not as sleepy. It’s 10:45 here, I woke up a little while ago but just sorta laid in bed for a few hours. Nights are significantly harder than daytime, so I feel better now.

I know we’re strangers, but having notifications is just strange for me. I’m not used to it at all. I don’t have a lot of friends. Or any, really, besides my siblings. So thank you all for being there. It genuinely means everything to me. ","Yeah that’s one thing that really made this scary for me. Usually my plan is to do it a lot more painlessly (I’m terrified of pain) but it was just so… impulsive. Idk. Last night I was overcome. Like the shadow monster that’s always creeping nearby just sorta overtook my mind and didn’t let me think right anymore. I have wanted to die a lot of times, I’ve even planned it out and written notes… but last night was some other kind of beast. I never would’ve wanted to die that way. It just sorta culminated last night for some reason.

I’m better now! I didn’t do anything.

I’m trying to eat breakfast right now but I just keep looking at the two biscuits I have and feeling absolutely no appetite. I’m trying to take the steps. I’m just so tired. But I don’t want to be tired, you know? I want to be hungry. I want to eat. I’m just so tired. 

I’m trying though. And I don’t think I’m doing horrible, if I’m comparing to last night. Every time I get bummed today I just look at this post and all the comments and I try to like… squeeze out the energy these people have put here so I can just take one more step. 

I’m better now, but still drained and tired. I brushed my teeth earlier and now I’ve got these biscuits. It’s been four hours since I woke up though lmfao. I feel so slow. I’m doing my best tho

Thank you for commenting <3 I’m glad you’re here right now. It helps knowing someone understands. I believe in you, too! Maybe if we believe in each other then we can lighten the load.

u/notreallyanywher,u/notreallyanywher,"Can someone please tell me not to go I wrote a note. I packed a bag with pills and water. I don’t want to leave. I know if I leave I’m not coming back home. Im scared. 

I know it sounds stupid but can someone just tell me not to leave the house? Like we don’t even have to talk or anything. I just want to feel like one soul on this earth is actually making the choice for me and telling me to stay. So I can cop out. Please. I want someone to take the blame for being the reason I stay home instead. 

I’m like a fucking damsel in distress and I can’t make my own fucking choices. I just need a cop out. 

Edit: I am staying home and going to bed. You’re all so sweet holy shit, I didn’t think anyone would respond to this… I am safe and I’ll update you all in the morning when I wake up. I am beyond grateful for every single comment I got. I cannot stress that I really was about to go, but I didn’t. You’re all very good people. I feel shitty for having taken up your time, but also so grateful that people cared. Thank you so much. 

Edit2: omg guys. I feel so loved. I don’t know what happened last night, I just sorta got weak I guess. I’m not usually THAT bad. I mean, I have depression and everything, but it’s usually manageable. You all helped so much. I feel like absolute shit for having wasted everyone’s time like this, but also I know a bunch of you are telling me I didn’t waste anyone’s time… idk, I’m just confused. I’m still tired, but not as sleepy. It’s 10:45 here, I woke up a little while ago but just sorta laid in bed for a few hours. Nights are significantly harder than daytime, so I feel better now. 

Thank you all for the love you showed, my inbox is absolutely overflowing. I wanna respond to everyone… I feel like you’re all my friends checking in on me.

I’ve been applying to jobs for the past two years. Seven years of work experience, a Bachelor’s with Honors, internships with the federal government, and thousands of applications, yet all I’ve been able to land is a barista job in a roach infested cafe making peanuts. I’ve done everything everyone said was right, but now all people can say to me is, “the job markets just bad now,” or, “you’re an amazing candidate, but we won’t be moving forward.” Seems that this is really all I’m worth after all.

Edit: People have made fair points about surviving the fall in a car, so I think I will instead jump headfirst. The interstate is busy enough that someone will be bound to hit me afterwards, anyways.

Edit: Just closed up. After reading the comments, I realize it struck a nerve about landing in traffic.

i’m on the brink of killing myself. i can’t decide between overdosing or hanging myself. i’ve been going to therapy and trying to talk this out, but the pain i feel and longing for him is so overwhelming i don’t think i’ll be able to move on. i see how suicide effects all the people around you, but i honestly just want to be with him again. all i want is him. i want him back. my life will never be the same. i keep reading about the afterlife and near death experiences trying to make sense of all of this. i hope he’s in a better place and i hope that i can be with him too. do you think there’s a spiritual realm where he exists and we would exist together? if death is such a loving place full of peace, grace, and no negativity, why WOULDN’T you want to take your own life? oh my sweet boy, i’m so heartbroken. this is unreal. he was only 19. we were supposed to be together forever. we had so many fucking plans ","because i’m not a complete stranger. i was his partner. and yes, they asked for my consent to release my phone number to his parents. you are clinically insane preying on people going through loss and someone considering suicide. you are disgusting",3,4,1,"[2.0066993e-03 1.2752663e-03 6.6923061e-03 1.2760777e-02 8.6244857e-03

u/KitsuneCreativ,u/KitsuneCreativ,"Please help me. This is urgent, I need advice quickly. I am going to lose him. I'm shaking while typing this. My friend, who has previously been very open about being suicidal and has been worsening throughout the past couple months, stating he'd commit suicide within the year, joined a voice chat I was having with another friend, and said that he almost died without elaborating. Then, a couple minutes later, he started randomly repeating an exact date, time and location. February 3rd, 10pm, along with a location I will not say. I tried finding this on Google maps to see how close it was to his house. After a bit, he sent me and my friend a link to Google maps street view. It was the location he stated, a view of being on a bridge with train tracks beneath it. The hint was obvious. On Saturday, my friend is going to try to kill himself. Please, reddit, what should I do?

Edit: I have spoken to my parents and will speak to a school Councillor tomorrow, and take it from there. If I don't update this, I either forgot to edit or didn't manage to save him.

Edit 2: Thanks for the advice, I know what to do already. You don't need to leave any more comments.

Edit 3: Im making this edit to tell you guys you don't need to be concerned for him and that he'll be fine. His mother is aware, not his father for personal reasons to him. His mum is keeping an eye on him and now he has no possible way to get there since it's far away. Thank you guys, I think you've all helped save a life.

Edit 4: February 3rd, 11:03 and he's still alive and at home. He's safe. I did it. Thank you guys so much. I love every single one of you who helped me and him. From the bottom of my heart, thank you all.

Hey guys. Writing this the day after. He attempted suicide. He did this around midnight last night. He sent a message and ten minutes later I saw it and quickly got my parents to call his mum. I think that was the only reason his mother was able to wake up in time and stop him. If I hadn't checked my phone last night because I was bored, I probably would have lost my best friend.

","I have hurt everyone who’s ever been close to me due to my inability to control my emotions. I stole to feed my addictions. I wasn’t good enough for anyone. I broke property that wasn’t mine in fits of rage, and shut down at the first sign of criticism or conflict. 

I was a massive bastard to my first gf, and a leech and parasite to my second. I threw a glass past my best friends head in an argument. I traumatised my second gf when i disappeared for two hours and almost died.

I lied about who I was. About my relationships with my family, friends, everything. I’m nothing but a lying thief who covered up a drug problem bigger than they realised

They haven’t spoken to me since. Now i’m stuck at my shitty family’s shitty house with no way to escape from anything.

I’m sober now too, so all that’s left is the guilt of every action i’ve ever done my whole life. Every bad word. Every betrayal of a friend or myself to be liked or cared for. Every single person i’ve hurt, directly or indirectly. The guilt of it burns.

","I have hurt everyone who’s ever been close to me due to my inability to control my emotions. I stole to feed my addictions. I wasn’t good enough for anyone. I broke property that wasn’t mine in fits of rage, and shut down at the first sign of criticism or conflict.

I was a massive bastard to my first gf, and a leech and parasite to my second. I threw a glass past my best friends head in an argument. I traumatised my second gf when i disappeared for two hours and almost died.

I lied about who I was. About my relationships with my family, older friends, everything. I’m nothing but a lying thief who covered up a drug problem 

They haven’t spoken to me since. Now i’m stuck at my shitty family’s shitty house with no way to escape from anything.

I’m sober now too, so all that’s left is the guilt of every action i’ve ever done my whole life. Every bad word. Every betrayal of a friend or myself to be liked or cared for. Every single person i’ve hurt, directly or indirectly. It’s all too much

","It wasn’t intentional. It never was. I have BPD and controlling emotions is borderline (haha) impossible. I used to get really angry at people, and I managed to fix that somewhat. So instead I just froze up and disassociated or disappeared whenever I made a mistake or anything. That and I used to be an addict and stole from people to fuel it. I’ve been clean two months now. With that I have no way to escape the guilt of all the hurt i’ve caused with my anger, with my whole being.   

I really really tried to be a good person. I wanted people to like me so I lied about who I was, but I felt bad about lying so actually became who I said I was. I faked it till I made it. And then I failed because hiding my emotions and problems just made them spill out and burn everything.

7. I do not have a career
8. I have ruined my life because I cant learn
9. Mind is totally ruined. I have not done anything in last 10 years by anything I mean any-thing. I know nothing. I have totally ruined my life

some people will assume i'm aggressive, loud and ghetto and treat me accordingly. others will assume i'm ""trying to be oppressed"" and that being black is actually great and i'm just looking for a reason to complain. if i were born white or any other race, none of that would happen. remember that this was not my choice at all. nobody wants to be unhappy, i have tried my entire life to appreciate my skin and culture but i still feel very unhappy and disconnected to it. 


i feel like everyone is just judging me all the time and wants me to die. and i feel like both left-wing and right-wing people hate black people and think we're all miscreants. but if i were born as any other race, which could have happened, i wouldn't have to feel like a burden both economically and socially and i wouldn't live in my shitty family because i'd have a white family instead. i would just be happier and feel validated more and not always seen as a bad person. 


currently, i pretty much allow anyone who's white to walk over me because i would rather they make my life hell than i make them uncomfortable and maybe even confirm what they assume about me (that black people have a short fuse and are violet and commit crimes and we're scary and threatening and we aren't really human: try, apes, monkies or gorrilas). i always assume at the back of my mind that white people are always right and they belong and own this earth and country i'm just a subhuman who should be grateful to even be alive. i feel worthless compared to every other race, not only white people. seems like black is the most hated race with the worst stereotypes. 


i don't want to make this post last forever but i feel like the only thing stopping people from still hanging us and shit is just the law and fear of prison. i think innately, people feel fear or threatened by us and that makes me feel very miserable all the time. nobody sees us as human so nobody can sympathize with us. i can't even do anything about it and i can't physically change my race, it's not possible and especially in the summer as my skin is getting darker. i feel miserable all the time. i really wish i could be white - it's not fair that some of the things i have gone through that i twist and turn about at night wouldn't have happened if i wasn't black. im not implying white people or other races don't suffer, i'm talking about the conext of the personal things i have gone through. nobody would choose to be miserable, remember that. nobody who is sane would choose to be miserable, anything i am sad about is something that i have tried and tried to not hate myself over and see the good thing in. but when all the copes and all are used up, the reality is that i am still black and everyone still hates me either because i am pretending to be oppressed or because i'm a ghetto ruffian who loves committing crimes. so i still hate myself and nothing will fix that, even if i magically became white today, i will never get a white childhood and i'd still be stuck in this family and i'd have my experiences that still make me miserable.",3,1,1,"[1.6516395e-03 4.5589614e-04 1.7788844e-02 1.7306173e-01 1.1632255e-02

u/Awkward-Spring1411,u/Awkward-Spring1411,"I got too much love as a child. It’s ruined me. I’ve come to the conclusion lately that I do not want to live and function as an adult. I shouldn’t have to have any commitments or responsibilities. I should have died age 7. My life has been downhill since then. 

My parents loved - and still love - me so hard, it makes me hurt inside. I don’t know if that makes sense? I refuse to look for romantic love because the only people I want to care about are them. The more years I spend masking my true self (because nobody - nobody - would ever suspect I’m like this; me, the attractive, successful career woman who has bought her own apartment and been living independently for over ten years), the more I want to give it all up and just move back in with them and totally regress. I want to regress to the age I was when I didn’t know of negative emotions, or anxiety, of grief and loss. I want to be ignorant. I am both saddened and filled with rage that growing up happened. I want it to be just the three of us forever. To play with Barbies with my dad in the garden. I want to see colours as brightly as I used to. I want my mum to hold me tight. The love I experienced in my childhood is like a chokehold. On a bad day, old memories is all I can think about. I cycle through them in my brain and cry until I have no voice left.

Nobody asked me if I wanted to be an adult. Nobody checked with me. I watch my friends get married and have kids and I’m like why. Why do you want to adult so badly? How sad that you are now taking care of your own children. You should still be children yourselves. Why the fuck are we getting older?

And then, because everyone seems to be going down that path, I start thinking ‘What gene am I missing that I turned out so wrong?’

I would like to die a dignified death with my parents in a couple of decades’ time. I can hold on till then if I know I get to go with them. I fully intend to end my life as soon as they go, but I am hoping that they might be interested in looking into options of going the three of us at the same time.

u/SecretAccurate2323,u/SecretAccurate2323,"I am a worthless raped pig Story of my life is that im just a used cunt. Was raped as kid when a man close to my family decided to fuck me. Basically he just would tell people he was taking me places, but then get mad at me for random shit and fuck me. Things he punished me with rape for: getting sunburned, wandering off, letting my swimsuit top slip down, walking too slow, growing boobs, not finishing my food, not calling my mom to tell her where i was, not speaking to him in English, rejecting his kiss. He also would hold me down and let his friends have me. He rubbed oil on my nipples and took pictures of me splayed out. I remember him and his friend laughing together about how wet I was, saying that I liked it, and taking pictures of me to prove how much i liked it. When I started growing boobs he pinched them painfully and said I was a slut, and then laughed that my nipples got hard. I remember him sitting on my chest and forcing me to take his dick in my mouth. He also drugged me once and had me like that. He took pictures and videos of my body. 

As a teen I had relationships with older men where I would get emotional support from them and help and in exchange send them nudes and basically be their camgirl. I was so depressed at this time and would slash open my own vagina afterwards to punish myself. 

As an adult Ive been raped twice. One was so violent. He chocked me and beat me up and I got brain damage that I still struggle with.  Basically im a stupid fuck doll now too. 

The other rape was just some horny asshole. It still fucked me up though. Ive tried to kill myself a few times, but im too weak to go through with it. 

These rapes are the defining feature of my life. Im just a stupid used up cunt who deserves to die. I hate the sounds I made while being raped. I still remember listening to myself. I could not control myself and sometimes made little whimpers and squeeles when something hurt too much and i felt like my insides were ripping open. My rapist laughed at the sounds and said i liked it. I'm nothing. 

I won't make it through. Im not even pretty enough to be raped but it still happened. I deserve death. My mind and body is broken. I won't survive.

You'll probably end up even worse, brain damaged, organs compromised for life. These thoughts make me so mad. The world is overpopulated anyways, some of us are suffering inhumane amounts of pain and just want to leave with some dignity. I already know what life feels like and I just want to get out. 

Nobody will hurt if I leave, in fact their lifes will be better, I'm sure. Every decision I make turns out to be wrong, I can't do what I'm told, and the fact that they thought so highly of me growing up hurts even more. I mean, if everybody saw no future in me, it would've been easier. I was my family's only hope of getting out of poverty, I was supposed to make their dreams come true, I wanted that. But how could they know? I was such a wonderful kid for them. But I was awful since I can remember. It got worse after high school, I lost everyone that cared about me in the way, and I don't blame them. Lost years to mental illness and made my most loved ones' life hell. Now I'm almost 25, about to get fired from a job I get paid 1/4 of the minimum wage, no friends left. Never had a relationship, at least. That's way to sadistic even for myself. Last time I tried was in January. Took a lot of pills and now my liver's fucked up. Nothing. I bought new resources but my mom must've found them. Of course I'll not talk to her. She deserved a better daughter. She has a good heart. Her life would be 100% better without me here. I just want to end it this week. I don't want to turn 25. I don't want to have another birthday, to be reminded that I lived another year being a failure.","Not having children is one of the few things I'm sure of since a young age. I never wanted to let a creature grow inside me like a parasite and then all of the horrors that come after birth. And it's not very likely she'll kill herself because she's very christian and suicide is like the worst sin for them. Instant hell. She's mentioned that multiple times. She's at the church right now, by the way. At least she has all the sisters to help her out. She'll cry at first, of course, but it will pass.

But when I'm happy, it's like ""Maybe I don't wanna die. Maybe I don't want this to end."" Then the anxiety kicks in and I'm overthinking about all the things that could kill me. 

I guess being suicidal is a comfort. It's like i've been sad for so long that I don't wanna be happy. I often downplay my achievements or happy moments in my life. I always think ""Yeah, I'm happy now but later something bad is gonna happen"" It's like I equate everything.

A song started playing. Rises the moon. It broke  me out of the trance. My ex girlfriend used to sing it to me whenever I felt under the weather. I stepped back, fell on the ground and started crying like I never cried before. Everything, all the emotions and feelings I stuffed down and ignored for the past couple of months (because I couldn't let myself feel, had to focus on keeping and getting life in order) just came out. I realized what I was doing and couldn't believe it. I realized how much I have to lose and nothing to gain. How selfish that would be. How much pain it would cause everyone around me. That it probably would literally kill my grandma. 

When I was done bawling my eyes out I went to the ER and put myself on hold. I came home today. I don't know where this road is going but, God is my witness, I will watch this movie to the end and even stay for the after credit scenes. I will not end up on that roof again.","Honestly I'm not even sure where to begin with recording haha

To catch you guys up on what has happened the past month since my [last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/s/3hfFIGC50W), here: 

So not even a whole month after me and my gf broke up she got a new boyfriend so that's fantastic; everything she ever said to me was a lie, I wasted four months of my life, along with thousands of dollars on her, and she proved every bit of my overthinking right. Yay.

A week or so later I flew out to Chicago pursuing a job opportunity in sales that I learned of from one of the people who left comments on my previous posts. Chicago is 1,000 miles away from my home state and it was the first time ever leaving my state or flying on a plane since my family has always been too poor to travel. It was awesome. I was meant to stay for about 2 weeks but I cut my stay short to just 1 because you can't really do well in sales unless you can act happy-go-lucky, and that is surprisingly difficult to do when you were staring down the barrel of your revolver just 2 weeks ago. I chose to come back home to pursue therapy, medication, and to be around friends and family in this time of recovery. At the time of writing this though, I have failed to obtain any of those or a new job. The only thing noteworthy was me getting a membership at my local gym week ago, which I've already missed two days of since I have been unmotivated to do almost anything at this point.  

Now that we're caught up, here's what happened in the past two nights:

Last night I was out at the gym for ~2 hours give or take, and I brought my friends back with me into my house so we could chill and watch a movie or whatever. Upon opening the front door into my livingroom with my friends in tow, I am greeted by my mother sitting on the recliner with eyes full of tears. She sees my friends behind me and just says, ""No.""  So my friends and I back-pedal out the doorway, I walk them out to their cars and tell them I'll talk to them later, and then I come back in to ask my mother what happened. 

Apparently not even 10 minutes before I got home my father punched my mother in the head multiple times. And she wasn't lying either, she had a knot on her head to prove it. I asked her what caused him to do this to her, and she told me it was because she woke him up to ask for his assistance with our central A/C unit in our house, since it's an old piece of shit that breaks almost yearly and costs our family a fortune to repair. Keep in mind when reading the next few sentences that my father has a natural testosterone deficiency and he is prescribed a monthly testosterone shot, which I do not know the exact dosage of but my mother complains often that the dosage is too high, and combined with his already very short temper it's not a great combo.

My father gets up to go see what is wrong with the A/C, tinkers with it for a bit and starts getting pissed off, while my mother is telling him to leave it alone and offering to call a repairman the next day since this was happening at night in an attempt to calm him down. Upon hearing this, my father punches her in the head ~five times. 

I didn't know what the hell to say. Sure they've argued throughout my whole childhood and sure my mom has told me that he's abused her physically and mentally in the past but i guess I just got used to it, accepted it as normal for them to do, so i always just kind of dismissed it...but now that there was proof that it actually happened and my mother was sitting in front of me with tears in her eyes telling me all of it in great detail, I didn't know how to react. 

She slept in my room last night and then shit hit the fan a few hours ago.

About 3 hours after my father comes home from work, I hear a scream come from their room followed by my mother running to my room, with my father speedwalking behind her. I get between them and they're both in my room talking,  with me standing between them. My mother calls her father and one of her friends from work to come get her and my little brother (13). She says that she's leaving and that it's over multiple times to my father, while my father tells her multiple times that ""if you leave you ain't coming back."" My father does his best to impede her from being able to leave, taking their joint debit card, taking her car keys since the car is technically in his name, (even though she's the one that dumped thousands into it trying to get it fixed due to it being a shitbox) and trying to take her phone from her since that's technically in his name too.

Throughout my whole life while watching them two argue, I always did my best to stay as the neutral party but tonight I just couldn't do it. My father made a lunge at her to take ""his"" phone from her. They got into a struggle and I came behind my father and pulled him off of her by his neck. He didn't try to hit me, surprisingly. My mother ran outside and Asshole and I followed her out. I stood between them again while my father begged her not to leave. My mom, fed up with putting up with his bs for 20+ years said fuck no, it's over. My grandpa and my mother's work friend both arrive to help load her and my little brother's shit into their vehicles. Did I mention that my ""father"" also wouldn't let my mother take any clothes with her since those were also technically for him since he bought them? 

My mom didn't feel safe going back inside past him to grab any of her clothes and we all got into a screaming match outside while her friend and my grandpa watched. Seeing as tensions were obviously rising, my mom's friend then called the police. We were all inside when the police knocked and then they watched on as my mom grabbed her clothes, and they then escorted her and my brother out and then they left for my mom's friend's house. I am still here at our house, alone with Asshole and my dogs. I do not feel safe, and while I'm typing this I'm sitting in my room with my shotgun loaded in case he pulls something. During the whole argument I kept a knife on me too. 

I do not know what the hell I'm going to do, at all. I've got a friend who is living by himself in his own house, but I can't stay there for all that long since he can barely even support himself right now either, I'm scared for my dogs because my father is a very, very petty man and he's liable to shoot them just to be evil to us, and I've got no place for them to go. I've got only 300$ saved for myself, no job of my own still, and there's no places around me hiring. I figure it's only a matter of time before Asshole kicks me to the curb since his parents did it to him at 18 too so that somehow justifies him doing the same to me. This is honestly the absolute worst my life has ever been, and it's probably going to get even worse. I almost feel like walking into Asshole's room with my shotgun to shoot the both of us so we can't hurt anyone else anymore. I am on my knees right now and I haven't a clue of what in fuck's name to do next.

Now that we're caught up, here's what happened in the past two nights:

Last night I was out at the gym for ~2 hours give or take, and I brought my friends back with me into my house so we could chill and watch a movie or whatever. Upon opening the front door into my livingroom with my friends in tow, I am greeted by my mother sitting on the recliner with eyes full of tears. She sees my friends behind me and just says, ""No.""  So my friends and I back-pedal out the doorway, I walk them out to their cars and tell them I'll talk to them later, and then I come back in to ask my mother what happened. 

Apparently not even 10 minutes before I got home my father punched my mother in the head multiple times. And she wasn't lying either, she had a knot on her head to prove it. I asked her what caused him to do this to her, and she told me it was because she woke him up to ask for his assistance with our central A/C unit in our house, since it's an old piece of shit that breaks almost yearly and costs our family a fortune to repair. Keep in mind when reading the next few sentences that my father has a natural testosterone deficiency and he is prescribed a monthly testosterone shot, which I do not know the exact dosage of but my mother complains often that the dosage is too high, and combined with his already very short temper it's not a great combo.

My father gets up to go see what is wrong with the A/C, tinkers with it for a bit and starts getting pissed off, while my mother is telling him to leave it alone and offering to call a repairman the next day since this was happening at night in an attempt to calm him down. Upon hearing this, my father punches her in the head ~five times. 

I didn't know what the hell to say. Sure they've argued throughout my whole childhood and sure my mom has told me that he's abused her physically and mentally in the past but i guess I just got used to it, accepted it as normal for them to do, so i always just kind of dismissed it...but now that there was proof that it actually happened and my mother was sitting in front of me with tears in her eyes telling me all of it in great detail, I didn't know how to react. 

She slept in my room last night and then shit hit the fan a few hours ago.

About 3 hours after my father comes home from work, I hear a scream come from their room followed by my mother running to my room, with my father speedwalking behind her. I get between them and they're both in my room talking,  with me standing between them. My mother calls her father and one of her friends from work to come get her and my little brother (13). She says that she's leaving and that it's over multiple times to my father, while my father tells her multiple times that ""if you leave you ain't coming back."" My father does his best to impede her from being able to leave, taking their joint debit card, taking her car keys since the car is technically in his name, (even though she's the one that dumped thousands into it trying to get it fixed due to it being a shitbox) and trying to take her phone from her since that's technically in his name too.

Throughout my whole life while watching them two argue, I always did my best to stay as the neutral party but tonight I just couldn't do it. My father made a lunge at her to take ""his"" phone from her. They got into a struggle and I came behind my father and pulled him off of her by his neck. He didn't try to hit me, surprisingly. My mother ran outside and Asshole and I followed her out. I stood between them again while my father begged her not to leave. My mom, fed up with putting up with his bs for 20+ years said fuck no, it's over. My grandpa and my mother's work friend both arrive to help load her and my little brother's shit into their vehicles. Did I mention that my ""father"" also wouldn't let my mother take any clothes with her since those were also technically for him since he bought them? 

My mom didn't feel safe going back inside past him to grab any of her clothes and we all got into a screaming match outside while her friend and my grandpa watched. Seeing as tensions were obviously rising, my mom's friend then called the police. We were all inside when the police knocked and then they watched on as my mom grabbed her clothes, and they then escorted her and my brother out and then they left for my mom's friend's house. I am still here at our house, alone with Asshole and my dogs. I do not feel safe, and while I'm typing this I'm sitting in my room with my shotgun loaded in case he pulls something. During the whole argument I kept a knife on me too. 

I do not know what the hell I'm going to do, at all. I've got a friend who is living by himself in his own house, but I can't stay there for all that long since he can barely even support himself right now either, I'm scared for my dogs because my father is a very, very petty man and he's liable to shoot them just to be evil to us, and I've got no place for them to go. I've got only 300$ saved for myself, no job of my own still, and there's no places around me hiring. I figure it's only a matter of time before Asshole kicks me to the curb since his parents did it to him at 18 too so that somehow justifies him doing the same to me. This is honestly the absolute worst my life has ever been, and it's probably going to get even worse. I almost feel like walking into Asshole's room with my shotgun to shoot the both of us so we can't hurt anyone else anymore. I am on my knees right now and I haven't a clue of what in fuck's name to do next.

","I'm in rural Louisiana, a lot of resources around me are very scarce from what I know and I don't have a car to access any of it. My mother's income alone is no where near enough to feed her, my little brother, and me so that's why I didn't go with her.",2,1,1,"[6.80284109e-04 2.51213787e-04 1.26088399e-03 1.92429293e-02
