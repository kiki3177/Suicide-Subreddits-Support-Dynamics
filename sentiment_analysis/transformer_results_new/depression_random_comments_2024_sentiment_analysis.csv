Yall have pushed me soo fucking far!!! Finally today is the day. Kinda of weird how I’ve been waiting for this and it’s finally here. 

I’m usually stressed and saddened by the 
holidays but I feel a sense of relief maybe because I know I’m not going to have to deal with this anymore! 

Funny how people think I’m doing better too! I’ll make the best of my day go visit my favorite beach spot and grab my favorite food listen to my favorite music one last time

I know nobody will actually care and I’ve been hearing it for years “you’re too much to deal with, what about me!” so today is the gift everyone wants! 

Good bye everyone! 

If anyone I know or love comes across this thread after I’m gone just know I tried my hardest for the longest I could! 
And if you’re sad! “Get over it” just like you’ve told me! 

Does anyone even care!?  Friends and family don’t so why should strangers on some stupid fucking app!!! 

- still here but nobody’s heard from me! Haven’t been home! Seen posts asking about me. But still planning to end it! There will be a missing person report soon as it takes time for someone to be considered missing! I don’t plan on going back and only making want leave for good even more!

I sort of never cared until I witnessed the lives of my online friends over the years changing for the better.

One my friends graduated with a bachelor’s degree and was able to get a good job at a big company, another friend was able to start a business relatively young and it went well for them, one got married to the love of their life and moved in together. Everyone else seemingly able to get their lives together except for me.

That’s when it hit me. I was truly alone. I was stuck with nothing and nobody. I was completely stagnant. I was the only one who had such deep frustration from within towards life. I spent my life in deep isolation and repression and anger that I had realized that I wasted my life wallowing in my own misery unable to care about myself at all. 

I felt jealous. Jealous that they have a desire for life that I never had. I sabotaged my relationships and cut contact with all of them because it brought me so much pain to see them be happy.

That there’s nothing wrong going on and everything was perfectly fine. It made me despair. 

I suppose that’s what made me angry, what made me come out of my usual apathetic uncaring state.

I never cared about myself because I always hated who I am, and was never able to reconcile with myself about that. I became mostly numb about my own life, because I could always take myself out so it didn’t feel so bad.

Its just lonely to see others chase their own happiness while I cannot.

1. It’s so long ago that I genuinely don’t remember it, but I understand what you mean. 

I would say the only reason I was happy then was because I was a child. I had no responsibility and my view on the world was completely different.

2. How? Because I’m not trying to meet people. I feel utterly detached from everyone around me. Everything feels superficial and especially trying to pretend everything is fine in order to make friends with others is very hard.

I don’t care about my education, I don’t care about getting a job, I don’t care about any future prospects, I don’t care about my health nor care about my life in any capacity whatsoever. I don’t care about relationships.

I can’t bring myself to care about anything in life. 

All I want to do is lay down and do nothing till I pass away. I am sick and tired of everything. I just don’t care at all. 

I never understood how everyone else could find whatever it is they want to do in life and care about it.

","I am actually a teacher and I’m so glad you shared this. I stopped doing “back from break” activities many years ago, and all of my teacher friends thought it was odd. These activities made me so upset when I was younger, and still even so as an adult. I taught in one of the wealthiest counties in my state and maybe 70% of the class would have a magical Disney trip or a skiing vacation in Colorado. I felt myself melting along with watching the dejected faces of the remaining 30% of the class. I finally decided I didn’t care what all the other teachers did; I refuse. Instead, we either completely ignore it or sometimes I’ll ask the kids “what’s the most boring thing you did over break?” I’ll tell them I deep cleaned or did taxes. So sick of catering to the wealthy few. They get enough catering as is. Done with that.",3,3,1,"[0.00361278 0.00173064 0.00520486 0.1236814  0.03808681 0.00292409

I do know that people say this (I mean, cheat days are a thing for a reason). But, after the first couple of months I didn't really need one save for every couple months or so.

If I've eaten nothing but canned tuna for two months, when it comes time for canned tuna the 5th time that week I'm going to go, ""Now this... This I love!""

I guess one thing that does frustrate me a tiny bit is the amount of effort vs the payoff. I go to the gym 5 times a week every week for 5+ months and I see basically no muscle. I am in the steepest caloric deficit medically recommended and I see some weightloss, but, it's not at the rate I see for others (I know comparison is the thief of joy, but, at some point who have to look around and go, ""Okay... What am I doing wrong?""). I work so hard I have literally given up weekends and sleep to produce insane results and I just have to cross my fingers and hope for a good promotion the end of the fiscal year.

u/Drunklemike,u/Drunklemike,my wife has ruined my life and future about 3 years ago I was making great money and my wife was working at a well known cable company. my health took a turn and I was diagnosed with a form of congestive heart failure from scar tissue on my heart that formed from an accident that happened when I was 16 (im 31) where I was nearly fried to death by 480v.

u/throwawaycuzyeahs,u/throwawaycuzyeahs,"They always say ""it gets better"". It's been 2552 days since my suicide attempt. How much longer do I have to wait until things actually get better? It's never gotten easier to make friends, or get a girlfriend. Four years of therapy can't stop you from being awkward and ugly. When things were looking up and a few years ago I did get a girlfriend and friends, I still felt empty, and that girl would go on to make me feel like I'm worthless.

I'm probably autistic in a world meant for non autistic people. I have thoughts and behaviors behind closed doors that would make me sound like Joe Goldberg and totally identify me as a creep. Why should I gamble with the fact that someday I may do something horrible to someone that they don't deserve?

Why should I live when I am coded to not be happy in this world?

(I swear to god if I see a single ""don't give up"" or ""love is out there"" post without any other context you need to realize you are part of the problem.)



","Thank you for your comment.

Although, I didn't do nothing. I went to therapy for 4 years. I have had 7 years of social interaction since then. Socializing did not get any easier. At this point I would rather die than keep trying to improve.

Also saying ""it gets better"" implies that time is the only factor in improving. I've had 7 years and voluntary attempts on my end and it in fact has not gotten better.

Suicidal as well. Normally I’m pretty good at masking, but holy fuck for the last few months I swear anytime I hear her voice I’d rather die than have the fucking talk with her. “Can you excuse me while I go blow my brains out?” Kind of thing.

Divorce and therapy is not in the cards. I just want to rest, no more pressure, no more need to act fine or happy when I’m the farthest thing from it.

Edit1: the way she says things to me I think. She has no love for me, only resentment. She just gets angry when I try to set boundaries. When I tell her that her words are hurting me. When she argues with me and just repeats things over and over and over and I try to explain that I’m emotionally broken and at my limit. When I’ve done something wrong she says I’ve down it 80000 times, she always exaggerates how many time or how often things happen.

Can’t separate, no money to support two households. No family or support structure to fall back on. Three kids that need a lot of care.

u/throwaway8464729205,u/throwaway8464729205,"What's the fucking point of being alive when life is nothing but pain? Throwaway because people at my law school know my main and I might actually unlive myself if they see this. 
On paper, I have a lot going for me. Succeeded in my dream of going to law school, have a house that is paid off, conventionally attractive (I'm past the point of social mores right now, don't worry, I'm humbled by my overwhelming sense of self hatred) Objectively, my life looks pretty good and I've reliably achieved almost everything I've gone after. 

That being said, being alive has become unbearable. I feel nothing and everything at the same time. I can't connect with people anymore. I'm terrified of every social interaction, and I've been taught through experience that I am not worthy of love in the eyes of others. 

I think that realizing this is what did me in. Around 5-7 years ago, I was consumed by depression and anxiety. I didn't feel worthy of existing, and even now I couldn't tell you why. I just couldn't see my own worth. Eventually, I drug myself out of the pit through a lot of introspection and personal work. I became the person I always wanted to be. I thrived, and it got me to where I am now. I found self-worth, which is something that I'd never experienced before 

Over the last year, things have declined and I'm in a darker place than I've ever been. I actually can't see the point of living anymore. I have gone through emotional hell over the last 3 years. For a while, I was able to compartmentalize. Now, that seems impossible, because how the fuck am I supposed to compartmentalize my feelings of worthlessness when literally almost every person in my life has given me every reason to believe I'm not worthy of love or even respect. 

It isn't in my head. I grew up with a father that, from the time I was 6, ntentionally brainwashed me into believing that my mother (who had primary custody) didn't love me and never wanted me. His entire side of the family helped perpetuate this. He also gave me nothing but conditional love while instilling in me that I'll never be enough for any number of reasons. 

Then, I spent my adolescence being goomed by a grown man under the guise of love. He then used that love to buy my silence as he helped himself to my body and then offered what was left of me to his friends. This is just the worst of it. Not to mention the constant cycle of cheating and leaving, just to come back to do it again. Enter substance abuse. 

Eventually, I got away from him. Met someone who treated me like I walked on water. He wasn't perfect, but he also got the worst, most unhealed version of me and it showed. I'm still not sure that I didn't deserve what he did to me in the end. In retrospect, I think I broke him too. Regardless, after 3.5 years he cheated on me with his ex, told me he didn't love me anymore, and left. Then he came back and spent the next six months using the immense love that I, regardless of my failings, felt for him to get laid while he found his current wife. 

I broke, but it allowed me to put myself back together again, better than I'd ever been before. Who I'd always wanted to be. I told myself that it was okay because it motivated me to become a kinder, healthier, more complete version of myself. 

Then I met the person who I credit with destroying that. He convinced me I could be vulnerable with him. I shared every part of myself, the darkest parts, because he made me feel like I was safe. Until he proved I wasn't. Year one, he turned my trauma into a weapon, oscillating between telling me that I was the most amazing person he'd ever met and punishing me for all of my failings as a human being in his eyes. Year two, I learned that he actually had a girlfriend and an engagement ring to give her the whole time. Year three, he's made it clear that I no longer matter to him. The more he hurt me, the harder I loved him, and I still wasn't enough. And in the end, when I told him how he had broken me, all he had to say was ""Haha sorry"". 

Add in a year of realizing that some of my closest friendships came from the fact that I was around and required nothing from them, and that the second I did, they had no use for me anymore. 

Now I'm alone. I have no one. 

I give and I give and I fucking GIVE. I bend over backwards to show the people in my life that I'd do anything for them, just to be shown that I'll never be good enough for anyone no matter what I do. 

Please don't tell me that it's going to be okay and I'll find my people. I'm almost 27. My life has been nothing but a cycle of everyone I let near me picking my bones clean until I have nothing left to offer them. Then they leave. Everyone leaves. 

I can't even take comfort in the idea that I'll have the human connections that I've been chasing my entire life because even if I do, I've been taught to expect nothing but pain in the end. Why would I seek something out that has never done anything but erode me down to a shell of a person. 

It isn't that I want to die. I just don't know how to convince myself to keep living. I'm empty inside. The only thing I feel is emotional pain so strong that I can't remember the last time that my chest didn't physically hurt. What's the point of any of this? Why would should I keep going when    all I've ever known is abuse that called itself love? 

Why would I fix myself if it's just so someone can come along and break me again? What is the point of believing I have value if no one else sees it.

I don't want to die, but death feels like a reprieve at this point. I just want someone to love me. Why is that too much to ask? ",I'm medicated.

I truly do wish that I was never born. 31 years of consciousness, and most of that has been nothing but misery.

Why do some of us have to live with so much pain while some get to live a relatively good life? I can't even catch a break, it just constantly gets worse.

My (28m) partner (27f) just left me after five years and i can feel myself falling into a deep depression. I will spare the greater deatils but things have been so incredibly difficult for me the past two months and i feel completely traumatized. Nothing feels important. nothing feels worth it. And i am fighting back panic attacks 24/7. I have a lot of friends and a lot of distractions but it all feels so hollow without her in my life. I am not doing good at all. I have started seeing a therapist.

With all this going on i have somehow started masturbating way more than i ever have before. Multiple times a day, surpassing what was a normal amount before. Every time i do im just thinking about how much I miss being with her and longing for what I had just a few months prior. its a cycle of having my mind race, thinking about her, thinking about the physical times we had together, the times we could be having right now, missing those times, getting horny, masturbating, thinking of her, relieving myself, then sitting there realizing i am a complete emotional disaster right now. Has anyone else experienced this? This increase in sexual thoughts and desires while going through depression? I cant seem to shake it.

It's been a rough day of driving uber and just thinking about how I screwed up my life. I'm 28, and I currently have about 2k in savings. I drive Uber and do part time sales for a gym. I live in a house with 7 other people I barely know. When I was 24, I had about 50k in savings and was working at a big time bank as a software engineer making a little over 100k a year. I used to live in a penthouse apartment with 2 close roommates. But after the pandemic, I felt unfulfilled by the work and quit my job to pursue my passions. I ended up going down a rabbit hole of business ventures that ended up draining all my money and getting 12k of credit card debt. Very stupid I know. I did pull off some cool stuff and learned I have a passion for sales and marketing but for the most part Ive been feeling lost ever since and the only things that keep me going is working out and training MMA, which is how I ended up doing sales at a gym. The job market is really bad for software engineers and even then, I'm not 100% sure if I want to return to the profession as it still feels unfulfilling. Sales is fun for me but it's not enough shifts so I have to Uber to pay the rest of my bills. Because of that, this whole day I've been driving around professionals going in and out of their jobs and just been feeling like a failure all day. I plan on finding more sales work but currently I'm barely making ends meet to pay my bills and honestly feel like I have no value. I get really down thinking I may never have what I once had or find even a comfortable place financially. And it makes me feel stupider for doing what I did.

I left my home-country together with my family 3 years ago and left everything behind hoping and wishing for a better life. I didn't have the best lifestyle or a huge group of friends, but i had friends i had school and i had freedom, i had a life. I was happy. I never thought i would end up like this or spend my days taking care of my family and my younger brothers waking up to cleaning all day long to cooking and putting my brothers to sleep. My father is abusive and extremly controlling, i can't leave the house or use my phone during nights etc. the only times i'm allowed to leave the house is when i have to follow him to the grocery store to help with the groceries. I'm not allowed to have social medias or stay in my room for too long. just small details i think anyone would find normal and not weird or ""wrong"". i'm tired of being controlled, i can't decide when i want to shower or when i want to do anything on my own. i used to love art, but i have no time for it anymore. I have no time for my self and there is no point in life.

I still hurt and cut myself but i know i have to do it somewhere they wouldn't be able to notice otherwise i'm pretty sure they would be very mad and hurt.

She's been starting to go to school more and has more friends and i'm scared that she's going to leave me.

I'm scared he's going to find out i have social medias or just anything that could make him get mad or physically abuse me.

I feel incredibly lonely, i have no friends, i don't go to school, i don't work, i don't leave the house. No one knows i exist.

I left my home-country together with my family 3 years ago and left everything behind hoping and wishing for a better life. I didn't have the best lifestyle or a huge group of friends, but i had friends i had school and i had freedom, i had a life. I was happy. I never thought i would end up like this or spend my days taking care of my family and my younger brothers waking up to cleaning all day long to cooking and putting my brothers to sleep. My father is abusive and extremly controlling, i can't leave the house or use my phone during nights etc. the only times i'm allowed to leave the house is when i have to follow him to the grocery store to help with the groceries. I'm not allowed to have social medias or stay in my room for too long. just small details i think anyone would find normal and not weird or ""wrong"". i'm tired of being controlled, i can't decide when i want to shower or when i want to do anything on my own. i used to love art, but i have no time for it anymore. I have no time for my self and there is no point in life.

I ended up in hospital a few months ago when i cut my self pretty deep 3 times in hope that it would frighten or bring any type of attention from my parents but everything is back to normal. I still hurt and cut myself but i know i have to do it somewhere they wouldn't be able to notice otherwise i'm pretty sure they would be very mad and hurt. I used to be very good in school and had so many A's, my dream was to work as a therapist... which is kind of ironic now that i'm searching for one..

i have one friend left that i used to be friends with back in my homecountry, she is my best friend and my only hope in life even though shes depressed as well. She's been starting to go to school more and has more friends and i'm scared that she's going to leave me. She has been getting a bit more distant from me and is usually pretty quiet and busy during calls. i feel so mentally abused by my father, i'm stressed 24/7 and especially around him. I'm scared he's going to find out i have social medias or just anything that could make him get mad or physically abuse me.

I watch as other people my age goes to school, gets jobs, goes out with friends and travels around the world. I won't be able to get a job in the future, i dropped out during middle school and even if i did get a job my father wouldn't let me mostly because i'm a female.

u/jeonkoo_,u/jeonkoo_,"i'm 18 and suicidal as i sit here crying in my bed as usual, i've decided to finally reach out to someone just anyone who could possibly see or aknowledge that i'm alive and that i'm also on this planet. I feel incredibly lonely, i have no friends, i don't go to school, i don't work, i don't leave the house. No one knows i exist.

I left my home-country together with my family 3 years ago and left everything behind hoping and wishing for a better life. I didn't have the best lifestyle or a huge group of friends, but i had friends i had school and i had freedom, i had a life. I was happy. I never thought i would end up like this or spend my days taking care of my family and my younger brothers waking up to cleaning all day long to cooking and putting my brothers to sleep. My father is abusive and extremly controlling, i can't leave the house or use my phone during nights etc. the only times i'm allowed to leave the house is when i have to follow him to the grocery store to help with the groceries. I'm not allowed to have social medias or stay in my room for too long. just small details i think anyone would find normal and not weird or ""wrong"". i'm tired of being controlled, i can't decide when i want to shower or when i want to do anything on my own. i used to love art, but i have no time for it anymore. I have no time for my self and there is no point in life.

I ended up in hospital a few months ago when i cut my self pretty deep 3 times in hope that it would frighten or bring any type of attention from my parents but everything is back to normal. I still hurt and cut myself but i know i have to do it somewhere they wouldn't be able to notice otherwise i'm pretty sure they would be very mad and hurt. I used to be very good in school and had so many A's, my dream was to work as a therapist... which is kind of ironic now that i'm searching for one..

i have one friend left that i used to be friends with back in my homecountry, she is my best friend and my only hope in life even though shes depressed as well. She's been starting to go to school more and has more friends and i'm scared that she's going to leave me. She has been getting a bit more distant from me and is usually pretty quiet and busy during calls. i feel so mentally abused by my father, i'm stressed 24/7 and especially around him. I'm scared he's going to find out i have social medias or just anything that could make him get mad or physically abuse me.
