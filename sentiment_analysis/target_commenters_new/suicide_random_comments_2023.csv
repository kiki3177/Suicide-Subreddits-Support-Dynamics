u/cguthrie013,u/cguthrie013,"there's nothing interesting to be said I've been cripplingly depressed since I was 8 years old. I've always been pressed into feeling like I'm evil and selfish for feeling suicidal, even when I'm asking for help. I cut myself, I'm fucking 32 years old, and I cut myself still. I dream of dying. I hope with every will that I will just drop dead, because I'm too much of a coward to follow through with anything. I've tried suicide many times before, with 2 of those attempts landing me in the ER. IDK, maybe my heart isn't in it, or maybe I'm just too much of a little bitch to follow through with any plans at all. I have a husband and 2 children. My son just turned 1 and my daughter is about to turn 9. I love them so very much, but I feel like all I do is draw their lives into more and more turmoil. I try to talk to people about it, but I get shunned and made to feel guilty for feeling the way I do. I tried to share some feelings with my husband this morning and he brought both the kids in to make me look in their face as I say I'm depressed and suicidal. I've tried therapists, but they seem to do nothing but make me feel worse. There also isn't much access to any healthcare at all, let alone mental health. Our only therapist in town would come into the local coffeeshop I worked at and tell her client's business to the front of house staff. I can only imagine the kind of things she has repeated that I have said. I guess I'm really just trying to get my feelings out in a way that I won't feel judged. I hurt. I hurt a lot. I don't want to leave my kids behind, but I'm beginning to feel so hopeless; like everything I do is just dragging everyone around me down with me. Maybe everyone's life would be better off if I wasn't there to destroy it. I don't believe in God, but maybe there is a reason why I don't get the help I'm asking for. Maybe I'm meant to die. Maybe I'm not meant to be a part of the living. Maybe happiness isn't for me.

Thank you for letting me vent my feelings.","I realize as I go back and read this, that I never actually vented a single feeling. I only explained why I think I am validated for feeling human, only explained why I need to feel and never once said how I felt. I honestly don't know which makes me feel more alone, the fact I tried to belt out my feelings to an audience and did nothing but ask permission to feel or that I actually have the feelings.",3,1,1

every day is the same. i hate being alive, i just want the pain to stop.

i've tried to reach out for help, but last time i did that i got put in a psych ward and was traumatized. thinking about it still makes me cry almost a year later. no one can save me.

I ask my friends from time to time if they also have thoughts and they say yes...but how do I know if mine are too much. Sometimes mine just feel so real and painful, and it scares me how frequently they can come at times. It further hurts me to even be considering suicide, which just makes me hate myself even more which only makes it worse and makes me more sad.

But there are times when I don't feel fully seen or understood by them, and then that can trigger more thoughts.

Also, I hope you also can live life to the fullest. I understand that at times it’s not going to always be that way, so I don’t want to invalidate you if you’re struggling because the world can be such a shitty place to be in.",1,1,1

u/Leather-Bend5813,u/Leather-Bend5813,"I dont know how much longer I can take this (may be triggering) I apologize if any of this is incoherent nonsense. im feeling a lot of things right now.

ill probably delete this later

&#x200B;

I know that I am selfish for wanting to die, but I dont think ill ever be happy with myself. 

my grandpa ruined me just as my grandpa said. he molested me and my family doesn't even know, but him and my grandma also spoiled me giving me whatever I wanted and letting me eat whatever causing me eating problems. I hate how I look and m appearance, and they dont help at all with me trying to change it and it is hard for me to change too because of how I was raised.

 and I think subconsciously I dont want to look good so my grandpa won't think so either. he always says he wants to see me lose weight before I die and that I should try harder, but when I do he says I look sexy. I hate this house and my appearance. 

I was also SAed by an ex but didn't realize for a while. when I was younger I thought my only value was my sexual appeal, and now my body is ruined, so I subconsciously think I have no value. I have stretch marks and scars, I have hidradenitis suppurativa (however u spell it) and although its a milder kind I have scars. and I have stretch marks and im so unsymmetrical.

 im afraid to never find someone who loves me and I love them. 

the only person who's number one I am is my grandpa, and I hate him. my mom has a husband and kids somewhere else now, and my grandma loves them most. my friends dont really talk to me and have their own best friends.

I know the scars my fade, and I could lose weight and try to get the desired body I want, but the scars will be there. and I will be uneven, I have stretch marks. im just so tired. we are all going to die anyway, and nothing I do here will last. I dont think that I can ever love myself, and I hate living where I do. I want to change and do things but my body and mind won't let me, and the people in my house dont help at all. and even if I did change, there are some things that I cannot change. 

as my uncle says, I am ruined, and I dont know what to do other than die. I just want to love myself and be loved, but at this point I dont think I ever will.

thanks for reading if you did","Thank you for the reply and kind words; I have found it is hard to find understanding people on Reddit at times.

u/Legitimate-Monk8571,u/Legitimate-Monk8571,"I need some advice. Everyone in this post is 13  
My friend, N, has a suicidal friend who has been rather awful to him, she keeps ""venting"" and never takes his advice, I asked him and he doesn't even know why he's friends with her.  
She has attempted suicide before because he muted their group chat, if I remember correctly.  
She's really wearing him down.  
The way I see it, He's responsible for his own actions, she's responsible for hers.  
My friend doesn't have to suffer because she can't handle being blocked.  
He keeps saying he can't ""abandon"" her.  


Am I being cruel here? There doesn't seem to be a right answer here, It's either he suffers or she suffers.","The problem is, he's trapped, he doesn't want to be associated with her, but he doesn't want her blood on his hands, but he always complains, she keeps venting and talking, and doesn't take his advice, I'm seriously starting to think she's doing this for N's (platonic) love, not because she's sad that her grandmother died 4 years ago.

Only a few things have ever made me truly sad. I feel nothing most days. I don't mean the common despair or the apathy of living. I truly mean nothing. No motivation, no caring, no love, no joy, no sadness, no fun, no laughter, no enthusiasm, no entertainment, nothing. Just a never ending hollowness within myself. I am empty. I was never a person. I learned how to pretend by watching the people around me and learned to put on a mask.
Speak in higher tones because it makes people more at ease around you. Smile because it make you appear more pleasant to be around. Act goofy and people will think you're fun and enjoy themselves in your presence. Be funny because hey if you can't feel joy might as well make others feel what you can't. Study every behavior that every person displays. Learn every bit of psychology you can so you can pretend better. Always where the mask so you look just like them. I'm sick of it. I'm sick of this hollowness within me. I'm sick of always pretending for everyone else. I'm sick of the emptiness in everything I do. I'm sick of every little thing taking 200x the effort of everyone else. I'm sick of getting out of bed. I hate everything. I'm tired. I just want to sleep now. I'm so tired. My soul is dead.

u/Legitimate_Sir_6284,u/Legitimate_Sir_6284,"I’ve never been loved by my parents I’m (24m) done with life. I spent the whole day skipping class. Looking up resources for how to get support and feel love. I wasn’t loved by my mother nor father and it’s hard because they do everything for me. Like I’m 24 . No I don’t want them to do it for me. But they don’t support me. I don’t have the motivation to do things when I don’t feel loved. I’ve been depressed ever since I could remember. Suicide seems like my best option because I wouldn’t have to deal with anymore ups and downs. A therapist left me a message today because I had called today asking when I’d be assigned one and it pissed me off that I had to call. It’s been 4 weeks on the waitlist and when I’m down and out now you want to call me. And my parents have the nerve to tell me they’re there for me when they’re the reason I’m so fucked up. Anytime I’ve ever gone to them for help, I’m left feeling worse than before. I feel like a monster because of them, unworthy of anything. I’m just so done with them. And I had to rely on them as a kid, I wanted to run away before. But I had nothing to go to. And I don’t have anything to go to now. I would only work if I had to, not to advance myself. 
I’m left feeling like it’s my fault for even having needs at all","Yeah they took care of me financially too. Its hard to tell the difference, but I was just a tool to get their needs met. Its the same for me, both had significant trauma and justified some of their actions because of the trauma.  

It’s no wonder I would struggle, and now I’m just as bad as them. I have no idea how to form relationships and the ones I do form I struggle with using the same strategies they used on me, making people feel uncomfortable. It made me wonder if my life would have been different if even financially they weren’t taking care of me, if I’d still be around. I don’t think I would be.

Thank you for that.

I had to question if your compliment was for real, I know it’s bad. People would tell me that I’d always say deep things, I’m just talking from the hurt.

u/cherrymerrywriter,u/cherrymerrywriter,"My porn feels like constant, public rape I used to think I wasn't like the other girls who did porn. I wasn't the stereotype: sexually abused, broken, etc. Fast forward a couple of years at a female sex addicts anonymous meeting, and my mentor is challenging me, asking why I can't have emotional connections with men, why sex always feels like I have to strangle my own humanity. Well... this is all I know. Isn’t this what sex is supposed to feel like? They ask me to write my sexual history starting at the beginning. I've never done this before.  
  
My first sexual experience was when I was in second grade; when my friend's older brother at a sleepover climbed into my sleeping bag. That's when it all began. The inner conflict. My struggle with loving vs. hating myself. Recreating the experience because it was the only way I knew how to orgasm. I didn't know what the word rape was, but I thought that was what sex was supposed to feel like... it hurts, and then it feels good. Like you have to kill your own humanity to pay for the orgasm.  
  
It felt abusive and self-destructive to do this to myself, but I thought this was just the reality of sex.   
  
When, at 21 with my SAA mentor, all the pieces came together... the rug of my life was pulled out from under me.  
  
Is it rape if a prostitute agrees to sex for a certain amount, and after the john leaves, she discovers the money is counterfeit? Because that's what my porn feels like. My own life, a smattering of pieces I didn't understand. Until I did.  
  
Then, my porn felt like a constant public rape. If I ever have any success in anything, I will have to burn for it when people are unable to fight their temptation to look. For years after, I had to dress modestly and had to wear minimal makeup because it was extremely easy for me to feel violated. For the wound to be triggered and re-opened.   
  
Language wasn’t invented to keep the truth obscured.   
  
Of course, I became suicidal. I was for 4 long, arduous years where I felt too broken to ever even begin to attempt dating (how do you eventually tell a date, a guy that's come to care about you, that you did porn, and that it feels like constant rape?). The strength I've had to develop, and the spiritual agony I've had to endure have cost me every last drop of innocence I might have once had.  
  
All these years later, my porn still feels like public rape, but it doesn't make me cry anymore. It doesn't hurt enough to paralyze my life.   
  
However, I know I’m likely to be single forever and I’m likely to never have that safe, warm, trusty, cozy sex that’s apparently normal sex. Sometimes, I want to die because my life is a botch. Wouldn’t it be nice if people with botched, ugly lives like mine could be replaced by happy people living un-botched lives?
