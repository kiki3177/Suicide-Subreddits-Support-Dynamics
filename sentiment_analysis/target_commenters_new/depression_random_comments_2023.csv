u/SarahSamael,u/SarahSamael,"craving coma hello guys,
i’m pretty much new to creating posts in any subs, so please bear with me.

i feel like there’s no escape from my pain and even though i’d love to die, i feel like it’s not exactly what i want. what i want is more like sleeping for days, weeks even, to avoid the pain i can’t handle. 

it’s so bad i started researching how to achieve this. i know that many people feel like this, but does this feeling ever end without the help of other people? 

i kinda don’t have anyone i can turn to, i do have friends that would probably want to help but i don’t wanna bother them and i feel like they can’t make me feel better anyway. that’s why i’m considering this option, because i don’t know how else can i get rid of the pain.

any ideas how to make this stop please?",I have a therapist and friends I always talked to but…it just doesn’t help. Letting it out doesn’t help me anymore. The pain is so bad it just stays buried in my body even after I talk about whatever caused it. There’s seriously no escape from it anymore. But thank you for reaching out anyway.,3,1,4
u/SeaResponsibility70,u/SeaResponsibility70,"answer me if you can I am not sure if i should be here. If not tell me an i'll delete my post.  In the last 2 n a half years i have been dealing with some stuff. After about 9 months one or my friendships ended. I was 12 at the time, they were 19 and 17 (online friendship). I guess i got a bit too caught up in it and i lost sight of reality. I was there all the time and then poof its gone. Since then until around august 2022 ive been dealing with these depressive episodes and this grayness. I cant really explain it, its like this sort of filter on the world that makes everything seem pointless (not in a nihilistic kind of way) and boring. And since august its that ive been having weirder and weirder toughts. As i couldnt stop thinking opinions in my head as messed up that i wouldnt dare to say here formed. Even tho the grayness is gone these shitty opinions have been haunting me. After the suicidal toughts came i felt i really needed to do something. And for the past some days (less than a week) I have been ignoring. Running away from them as much as i can. Ive came here to ask you: what is my next step? A psychologist? A psychiatrist? Or can i handle this myself? What should I do",Tysm!,4,4,1
u/Saulgoodmafagga,u/Saulgoodmafagga,"I wouldn't read this, it's a total bummer. Hey everyone. I'm not sure exactly what I expect from this. No offense, but I doubt a bunch of depressed people can offer much to turn around my own depression. But I don't know, I need something, man. My depression has such a deep hold of me right now. For a long time, it's like you don't even know it's there. Maybe you just had a bad day. Or a couple of bad days in a row. And then you realize it's been like this for almost two years now. At least that's what it's like for me at the moment.

I'm still trying, you know, sorta. I still have hope that things might get better, eventually. But I'm having trouble just getting out of bed in the morning. I live in Norway, so there's like four hours of daylight during the winter, and I'm missing all of them, and it's freezing outside.

I watched this youtube video yesterday because I wondered if there was some link to depression and memory loss. Turns out there is. I ended up watching another one, which was like a ten symptoms of depression kinda thing. I had every one them. I'm not eating well. I'm not sleeping well. I forget things constantly. I can't focus on anything for longer than a few minutes. I skip fifteen seconds at a time, fifteen seconds, fifteen seconds, fifteen seconds, through movies on Netflix because I get too bored to even pay attention. I skip to end like, just tell me what happens, it doesn't matter. 

I quit my job about two months back. They told they would have to fire me if I didn't quit on my own. It was the first job I've had based on my education. I just couldn't do it. No matter how much I tried. I would forget stuff constantly. It's like my brain refused to learn. I made so many mistakes. My boss even asked me if I had some type of learning disability she needed to know about. Anyway, the quality of the work just wouldn't improve and I eventually figured it would be better to tell my next employer that I had quit, rather than that I got fired.

Now I'm living off my last paycheck, staying at my mom's place. I haven't applied for a single job. Not one. I'm lying to people, my girlfriend included, and telling them that I have. But I'm just so down, all of the time. The things that used to excite me no longer do. Music sounds annoying, unless it's slow and sad and without vocals. I can't get through even four pages of a book. I'm not writing. None of my ideas interest me anymore. I go outside and I just have nowhere to go. The world seems like a cold, boring shopping mall, not selling anything that I want. My friends are all busy. Having jobs and lives. 

I can't find anything that I want to do. Except drugs I guess. But I don't do them. I know they'll only make things worse, there's no point. I just want to snap out of this and be something close to happy again. But I can't find any direction in life I want to go. I look for jobs online(occasionally) and they're all like ""Hey! Do you fucking love our corporate culture? Well even if you don't, you'll have to pretend to! Come help us expand our markedplace into new and exciting territories of paperclip insurance! We offer competitive salary options, meaning you'll barely scrape by each month. And you can piss your life away in our depressing office building while you're at it!"".

Sorry. I know that's not helping. It's just the way I feel. Like I'm getting absolutely fucked by life. And like I'm totally powerless to do anything about it. At this point I'm actually considering just moving into the woods and building a log cabin. Just to get away from everything.

Words of encouragement and support have a bad aftertaste for me these days. But if you have any thoughts for me, I guess I'll read them. Might be some good content in there. I suppose I'd even be grateful, somewhere inside.

u/Sapphire2408,u/Sapphire2408,"Best work-model for people with mental illnesses? While I wouldn't say I have depression anymore (I think i handles it with SSRI's and a successful therapy), I still have severe body dysmorphia, which, just like depression, makes my days hell sometimes. Sometimes I get up and just don't want to go to work, because I feel so ugly and I know, the day is gonna be misery and make the situation worse. Staying home would be great then.

Right now, I work fully remote as a software engineer. My mental health is great because of that, but I really notice my social life is not what is could be. I never go out because my colleagues are just so distant. They work from all over the state and it's just too far for building relationships.

There are hybrid models too, like working from home 2 days a week and going to the office 3 days a week, but I feel like that wouldn't make the social aspect that much better as not all colleagues will be at work when you are.

&amp;#x200B;

Whats your opinion on that?","I completely agree. However, I feel like all work models have their pros and cons. Working fully remote definitely makes me worry less and reduces anxiety. Going to the office full time makes me more social and feel more integrated at the cost of feeling shitty way more often. Also, it's better for my health, as I move WAY more then. Actually, since Covid, I gained over 20 pounds just because I don't go to work anymore and work from home instead.

I'm planning on changing companies soon that's why I'm wondering which model works best, but all of them seem to be kind of shitty.

i began a lifespan integration therapy 2 months ago and I have a strange feeling about my therapist.

Unfortunately no, they sent me to doctor to get nerve testing and he was so convinced it had to do with my heart that he wanted me to see a cardiologist first. He did say that he doesn’t think it’s MS. I go to see a cardiologist and they said that since I had testing six years ago, around when everything started, and it came back normal that they don’t think it need it again. My doctor also referred me to a rheumatologist, but I never heard from them. I did message my doctor asking again about the referral  and still waiting to hear anything. I’ve seen a neurologist also about seven years ago and he put me on cymbalta. That’s it. Otherwise I go in, explain my symptoms and they sign me up for physical therapy.

u/SaracenArcher,u/SaracenArcher,"Im worried that my high IQ will doom me. Is there hope? I have been diagnosed with OCD. Ive been on celexa for about 13 years and just recently came off of it since 3 months.

Recently, I had some triggers (reading about doctors  on reddit denigrating Physician Assistants, which I am, which sent me into a OCD spiral questioning who I am and my purpose). So for the past week, I have been extremely high anxiety.

I restarted my celexa out of desperation.

I have never taken an IQ test, but I know for sure I am above average. I have been reading that high IQ people have trouble with marriage and depression.

And now im worried that if celexa is keeping me afloat, what if it stops working? I'll be stranded

Reading about this stuff makes me feel like I am cursed and now I am reading that depression is progressive and it has me really worrying since I have had trouble with relationships in the past (32 and single) due to OCD.

I have an appointment with a psychiatrist and I do see a therapist.

u/SavinPat,u/SavinPat,"I dont have depression, but i dont wonna live anymore Hello. I want to apologize in advance for my English, I am writing through a translator, this is not my native language. All my life I was a man of nothing, from a poor family, with poor academic performance and few friends. In adolescence, everything changed drastically, I completely withdrew into myself and began to think about suicide almost every day. I have always had problems with my teeth, and until now it spoils the appearance of a fairly young person, and at the age of 17 my hair began to fall out, at the moment I have a huge bald spot. I completed my secondary education as a programmer, worked for 2 months and joined the army (this is mandatory in my country). And now, for 7 months now, I have been free, I can’t find a job as a programmer, and I’m not sure that I can handle it if something happens, my mother works alone, and it’s more and more difficult for me morally to do this with her, but also to work in positions other than a programmer I don't want. It also sometimes hits me very hard that by the age of 23, I have never had any relationships, and I’m not an incel at all, I just can’t meet the needs and give the girls what they need. I'm very obnoxious in person, and I can't control my jokes. Thoughts of suicide never leave me, but they are more like another bad thought that will never leave me until I commit suicide.

But I cannot get over the fact that I was never seen by anyone in my supposed “prime” as a young woman, there was never a hint of romance in my life. Seeing all the couples everywhere, especially right now in the summer, makes it impossible to forget that I am missing out on such a big part of life. I hang out by myself all the time for nearly a decade and all the couples remind me that I am a ugly leftover woman. While I go home in the evening feeling a bit paranoid about potential dangers, come home, have my meals alone, have nobody to talk to, no messages, trying to hold myself from hurting, there are couples calmly having a walk together holding hands, probably cooking and eating dinner together, kissing and cuddling before going to sleep afterwards.

u/ScuroSqualo,u/ScuroSqualo,"My life is objectively good: so why am I always feeling negative? I want to start by explaining my situation a little. I (28M) am living in a rented apartment with my partner, in which we have enough money for rent, groceries, dates, travelling and, to a lesser degree, hobbies. And even after all that, we can still save enough money in a month for a house.

We both have respectable jobs and higher education, and I also have loving parents and an extremely supportive older brother who's always there for me. I have some very good friends that I get to hang out with at times and have at least a couple of laughs every day. However, I also experienced some form of mistreatment as a child (abuse, bullying, anxious attachment issues), so this might tip the scales in the opposite direction in one way or another.

Nevertheless, I feel like everytime something mildly bad happens at work or I fail another attempt at quitting one of my addictions, which are emotional eating & smoking, I fall into this ""pit of despair"" that makes me even more lethargic and miserable than I already was on the inside.

I feel like everytime something bad happens I reaffirm to myself that I'm both a failure and hugely unlucky in life, and that it would probably be much easier to ""quit life"" than continue because ""I'm clearly not made for this world"".

I know it sounds stupid and illogical, I've been going to therapy to sort it out, but haven't seen much progress yet. I don't know if it's because I've grown to become so overly pessimistic or that I have the wrong mindset to improve, but if there's one thing that i can say about me, it's that i do keep trying to improve, both for myself and my partner.

What else can i do to improve my mental situation? I just want to break the cycle of ""See? Told you that life sucks!"" and make the most of every day instead. Do I simply have depression, or could there be another cause?

Note: please don't suggest medication, I already know that route exists and will consider it if all else fails.

I also had lovers before, they were someone who gave light to me, at least a piece of hope to continue at least a bit longer, but at the end of the day, it's always me who gives pure strength to myself, as they do come and go. They have their own lives to live. I've been enough of a burden.   


I know that I need help. I seek for help with my friends, but the fact that they have their own lives to live, makes me hesitate to just rely on them fully at the moment, at least until I'm fine to walk with my own feet again. I'm also planning on at least asking for help on our counselor, because I'm really afraid  of what I'm capable of doing as of the moment.  


I might write some more here, but as of now,  I will stop here, as I'm having a hard time breathing lol.",I also am planning on living home for a while.,3,4,1

The past several months have been even worse for me. I am autistic as well, which makes me wish I could just get rid of myself even more. I tend to find my own community to not be helpful.

Nothing makes me happy anymore, absolutely nothing, I have no friends, just nothing to live for. I just want out of this miserable life. Im tired of talking and nothing changing. I tried all my life to change as everyone says and nothing has. Im tired of drinking until I throw up. I just want out of this life .",It’s not easy. I have autism.

u/SeaTop3388,u/SeaTop3388,"Wishing for a reason to be sad Hello, I don’t know if this kind of post is allowed on here but I’m just gonna send it. This past Sunday I was in church and as the preacher was reading the names of people who were in the hospital with a terminal illness or cancer or anything like that, I found myself wishing I had something like that. Not even just so I wouldn’t live anymore but more so just so I would have a reason to be this sad all the time without people questioning it. I immediately regretted it after but I’ve been thinking about it for days now. Anyone had similar thoughts ever?",It’s quite possible. I just feel like all these people have such difficult struggles that they’re going through right now and they all seem so happy and joyous and then there’s me who isn’t going through things as bad as terminal diseases or cancer and yet I’m depressed. If I had a reason to be this way maybe people wouldn’t look down on it so much,3,1,1

He beat many times my mother and us kids too, once I think I was 6 or 7 years old he came to our home very early in the morning and really drunk and put knife in my throat and yelled ""now I see you last time!"". Then when we boys started to grow up our father moved away, I think he started to get worried he couldn't beat us anymore so he was maybe littlebit scared. He died when I was 17 years old. Then when I was 18 my mom and step brother took loans in my name. I made financial bankruptcy I had debt 40 to 50.000. I paid almost all of them. I worked really hard couple of years so I managed to pay most of them. But there is sometimes bills still coming from 2013-2015 so it's hard to keep track how much debt I still have.",2,1,1
