holidays but I feel a sense of relief maybe because I know I’m not going to have to deal with this anymore! 

Funny how people think I’m doing better too! I’ll make the best of my day go visit my favorite beach spot and grab my favorite food listen to my favorite music one last time

Good bye everyone! 

If anyone I know or love comes across this thread after I’m gone just know I tried my hardest for the longest I could!

Does anyone even care!?  Friends and family don’t so why should strangers on some stupid fucking app!!!

I sort of never cared until I witnessed the lives of my online friends over the years changing for the better.

One my friends graduated with a bachelor’s degree and was able to get a good job at a big company, another friend was able to start a business relatively young and it went well for them, one got married to the love of their life and moved in together. Everyone else seemingly able to get their lives together except for me.

That’s when it hit me. I was truly alone. I was stuck with nothing and nobody. I was completely stagnant. I was the only one who had such deep frustration from within towards life. I spent my life in deep isolation and repression and anger that I had realized that I wasted my life wallowing in my own misery unable to care about myself at all. 

I felt jealous. Jealous that they have a desire for life that I never had. I sabotaged my relationships and cut contact with all of them because it brought me so much pain to see them be happy.

That there’s nothing wrong going on and everything was perfectly fine. It made me despair. 

I suppose that’s what made me angry, what made me come out of my usual apathetic uncaring state.

I never cared about myself because I always hated who I am, and was never able to reconcile with myself about that. I became mostly numb about my own life, because I could always take myself out so it didn’t feel so bad.

Its just lonely to see others chase their own happiness while I cannot. I’d feel far less miserable if I could sign my own death warrant immediately than sit around and forever torment myself with the lives of those around me.",3,1,1

I read what was said about my situation with my girlfriend and I guess I’ve decided to think about it, maybe it will be better sharing this burden with her even though it kills me inside that I’d be putting something like this on her as I feel like I am just dead weight and will just only make things worse for her in the long run. For whoever asked as well, I have a brain tumor called glioblastoma and I was told treatment can’t cure it just keep me alive longer",1,1,1

I do know that people say this (I mean, cheat days are a thing for a reason). But, after the first couple of months I didn't really need one save for every couple months or so. I think it may have something to do with having low-level Aspergers. We like consistency. If I've eaten nothing but canned tuna for two months, when it comes time for canned tuna the 5th time that week I'm going to go, ""Now this... This I love!""

I guess one thing that does frustrate me a tiny bit is the amount of effort vs the payoff. I go to the gym 5 times a week every week for 5+ months and I see basically no muscle. I am in the steepest caloric deficit medically recommended and I see some weightloss, but, it's not at the rate I see for others (I know comparison is the thief of joy, but, at some point who have to look around and go, ""Okay... What am I doing wrong?""). I work so hard I have literally given up weekends and sleep to produce insane results and I just have to cross my fingers and hope for a good promotion the end of the fiscal year.

Idk. I worry I'm falling into the trap of my generation needing instant gratification, but, it does feel like hard work pays off a lot less for me than it does for others sometimes.",3,1,1

When I was 6 years old I used to draw pictures of heaven and when I was 10 I asked my mom if there was a place people could go if they don’t want to live anymore. There’s no reason for me to be here.

u/liv_marketing,u/liv_marketing,I don’t want to die but I don’t want to live. I’m a 31F who is just going through a tough time. I found out my bf 29M of 3.5 years was cheating on me with a 23F he worked with right before we were supposed to move in the house I bought for us together. We ended up going our separate ways but dated on and off for a year until I finally realized he made me feel terrible and I was better off without him. I dumped him last week and I don’t miss him but I feel really empty. I don’t want to start all over again with someone else. I live in a town with no family or friends nearby. I can’t explain how I feel but just so uncomfortable in my own body. All I can do is doom scroll on social media to try to keep myself occupied. I feel so empty and I want to end my life so I stop feeling this way. Has anyone else felt like this and did it go away :(,Thank you so much for sharing this. I totally get the worth part … you never realize how much being cheated on makes you question everything about yourself. You are so strong for getting through this time with the loss of your father as well. Thank you again for taking the time to share this with me 🤍 it’s good to know I’m not alone.,1,1,1

u/TheRealGarbanzo,u/TheRealGarbanzo,"I Think I Just Experienced How Dangerous Depression is and How Much Trouble I May Be in Last night, something happened. I took a walk to calm down and that's when I made a mistake.

I got high during this walk and went to the nearby train station to sit down for a while

Before I left I was having very bad thoughts. Thinking about how much easier things would be if I was just dead

An express Amtrak train was coming through the station. I didn't know it was an express train so I stood relatively close to the track (on the platform) so I could experience the train going by

The train that actually came, came by fast. It rumbled the ground, was loud. It honestly scared me as it flew past, the suction from the last few cars even moved me around slightly 

After this, I went to Wendy's and there I think I was able to uncover the real reason I feel the way I do. I have no direction in life. I feel like a failure already in my early 20s. I just dont see a future in which I'm happy

I'm sorry if this next part doesn't make sense
I'm trying to remember how I felt last night, laying down. I was scared, I never felt such a terror at the thought of what could be happening to me.

I felt like there's two different personalities in me and one of them is okay with dying and the other really isn't. And the one that really isn't okay with dying is being suppressed normally. But last night I think I felt it. The terror of knowing that there could be this thing inside me, alerting the way I think against my will. Making me think that suicide is the answer 

I'm not sure why I went to the station. I didn't have any intentions to do anything. But I wondered, ""what if I was feeling worse?"" If what I experienced isn't just from me being high, could whatever is making me think this way really win one day?

I know this didn't really make sense but I'm having trouble finding the words to describe what happened..

I just wanna ask, has any one you experienced something like this?",I'm glad you're still here,3,1,1

I asked my mom if she could help me get some food and she said sorry ""that sounds like it's not my problem"" which is crazy because she wants me to donate a kidney to her. She told me she loves me to other day and I finally told her that she doesn't care about me in the slightest other than my organs and that in my entire life I can't think of a single instance where I felt like she cared about me in the slightest. In 2016 I made an attempt on my life and she cussed me out and called me selfish because she couldn't get my kidney like that.",3,1,4

Although, I didn't do nothing. I went to therapy for 4 years. I have had 7 years of social interaction since then. Socializing did not get any easier. At this point I would rather die than keep trying to improve.

Also saying ""it gets better"" implies that time is the only factor in improving. I've had 7 years and voluntary attempts on my end and it in fact has not gotten better.

Suicidal as well. Normally I’m pretty good at masking, but holy fuck for the last few months I swear anytime I hear her voice I’d rather die than have the fucking talk with her. “Can you excuse me while I go blow my brains out?” Kind of thing.

Divorce and therapy is not in the cards. I just want to rest, no more pressure, no more need to act fine or happy when I’m the farthest thing from it.

Edit1: the way she says things to me I think. She has no love for me, only resentment. She just gets angry when I try to set boundaries. When I tell her that her words are hurting me. When she argues with me and just repeats things over and over and over and I try to explain that I’m emotionally broken and at my limit. When I’ve done something wrong she says I’ve down it 80000 times, she always exaggerates how many time or how often things happen.

Can’t separate, no money to support two households. No family or support structure to fall back on. Three kids that need a lot of care. 

Edit2: somehow a bunch of people are confused and think I hate my wife and kids. That’s not the case. My kids are more precious to me than anything.

u/throwaway8464729205,u/throwaway8464729205,"What's the fucking point of being alive when life is nothing but pain? Throwaway because people at my law school know my main and I might actually unlive myself if they see this. 
On paper, I have a lot going for me. Succeeded in my dream of going to law school, have a house that is paid off, conventionally attractive (I'm past the point of social mores right now, don't worry, I'm humbled by my overwhelming sense of self hatred) Objectively, my life looks pretty good and I've reliably achieved almost everything I've gone after. 

That being said, being alive has become unbearable. I feel nothing and everything at the same time. I can't connect with people anymore. I'm terrified of every social interaction, and I've been taught through experience that I am not worthy of love in the eyes of others. 

I think that realizing this is what did me in. Around 5-7 years ago, I was consumed by depression and anxiety. I didn't feel worthy of existing, and even now I couldn't tell you why. I just couldn't see my own worth. Eventually, I drug myself out of the pit through a lot of introspection and personal work. I became the person I always wanted to be. I thrived, and it got me to where I am now. I found self-worth, which is something that I'd never experienced before 

Over the last year, things have declined and I'm in a darker place than I've ever been. I actually can't see the point of living anymore. I have gone through emotional hell over the last 3 years. For a while, I was able to compartmentalize. Now, that seems impossible, because how the fuck am I supposed to compartmentalize my feelings of worthlessness when literally almost every person in my life has given me every reason to believe I'm not worthy of love or even respect. 

It isn't in my head. I grew up with a father that, from the time I was 6, ntentionally brainwashed me into believing that my mother (who had primary custody) didn't love me and never wanted me. His entire side of the family helped perpetuate this. He also gave me nothing but conditional love while instilling in me that I'll never be enough for any number of reasons. 

Then, I spent my adolescence being goomed by a grown man under the guise of love. He then used that love to buy my silence as he helped himself to my body and then offered what was left of me to his friends. This is just the worst of it. Not to mention the constant cycle of cheating and leaving, just to come back to do it again. Enter substance abuse. 

Eventually, I got away from him. Met someone who treated me like I walked on water. He wasn't perfect, but he also got the worst, most unhealed version of me and it showed. I'm still not sure that I didn't deserve what he did to me in the end. In retrospect, I think I broke him too. Regardless, after 3.5 years he cheated on me with his ex, told me he didn't love me anymore, and left. Then he came back and spent the next six months using the immense love that I, regardless of my failings, felt for him to get laid while he found his current wife. 

I broke, but it allowed me to put myself back together again, better than I'd ever been before. Who I'd always wanted to be. I told myself that it was okay because it motivated me to become a kinder, healthier, more complete version of myself. 

Then I met the person who I credit with destroying that. He convinced me I could be vulnerable with him. I shared every part of myself, the darkest parts, because he made me feel like I was safe. Until he proved I wasn't. Year one, he turned my trauma into a weapon, oscillating between telling me that I was the most amazing person he'd ever met and punishing me for all of my failings as a human being in his eyes. Year two, I learned that he actually had a girlfriend and an engagement ring to give her the whole time. Year three, he's made it clear that I no longer matter to him. The more he hurt me, the harder I loved him, and I still wasn't enough. And in the end, when I told him how he had broken me, all he had to say was ""Haha sorry"". 

Add in a year of realizing that some of my closest friendships came from the fact that I was around and required nothing from them, and that the second I did, they had no use for me anymore. 

Now I'm alone. I have no one. 

I give and I give and I fucking GIVE. I bend over backwards to show the people in my life that I'd do anything for them, just to be shown that I'll never be good enough for anyone no matter what I do. 

Please don't tell me that it's going to be okay and I'll find my people. I'm almost 27. My life has been nothing but a cycle of everyone I let near me picking my bones clean until I have nothing left to offer them. Then they leave. Everyone leaves. 

I can't even take comfort in the idea that I'll have the human connections that I've been chasing my entire life because even if I do, I've been taught to expect nothing but pain in the end. Why would I seek something out that has never done anything but erode me down to a shell of a person. 

It isn't that I want to die. I just don't know how to convince myself to keep living. I'm empty inside. The only thing I feel is emotional pain so strong that I can't remember the last time that my chest didn't physically hurt. What's the point of any of this? Why would should I keep going when    all I've ever known is abuse that called itself love? 

Why would I fix myself if it's just so someone can come along and break me again? What is the point of believing I have value if no one else sees it.

I don't want to die, but death feels like a reprieve at this point. I just want someone to love me. Why is that too much to ask? ",I'm medicated. I got on SSRIs during the last relationship I mentioned. Maybe it's time for an adjustment. I'll look into it,2,2,2

I truly do wish that I was never born. 31 years of consciousness, and most of that has been nothing but misery.

Why do some of us have to live with so much pain while some get to live a relatively good life? I can't even catch a break, it just constantly gets worse.

He also has a problem with porn (again might seem funny but I’m worried) he regularly sends extremely brutal pornography or people having sex with dead animals,he also has the problem that he doesn’t care abt his body att all, idk if he regularly drinks alcohol, but recently he emptied an entire bottle of some liquid (stuff to rinse your mouth) to drunk himself, he apparently puked 3-5 times.
Idk it might seem ridiculous to many people but 

I’m actually really worried abt his future and I wanted to ask, how can I know if he is suicidal?

u/Depressed_Jerkoff,u/Depressed_Jerkoff,"Depression and Masturbation...? Delete if not appropriate, my apologies.

My (28m) partner (27f) just left me after five years and i can feel myself falling into a deep depression. I will spare the greater deatils but things have been so incredibly difficult for me the past two months and i feel completely traumatized. Nothing feels important. nothing feels worth it. And i am fighting back panic attacks 24/7. I have a lot of friends and a lot of distractions but it all feels so hollow without her in my life. I am not doing good at all. I have started seeing a therapist.

With all this going on i have somehow started masturbating way more than i ever have before. Multiple times a day, surpassing what was a normal amount before. Every time i do im just thinking about how much I miss being with her and longing for what I had just a few months prior. its a cycle of having my mind race, thinking about her, thinking about the physical times we had together, the times we could be having right now, missing those times, getting horny, masturbating, thinking of her, relieving myself, then sitting there realizing i am a complete emotional disaster right now. Has anyone else experienced this? This increase in sexual thoughts and desires while going through depression? I cant seem to shake it. Even worse Ive gone back to old pictures and videos of us fucking while masturbating, knowing very well how unhealthy that is. I have stopped doing that but im sure ill be stupid and do it again.

I ended up going down a rabbit hole of business ventures that ended up draining all my money and getting 12k of credit card debt. Very stupid I know. I did pull off some cool stuff and learned I have a passion for sales and marketing but for the most part Ive been feeling lost ever since and the only things that keep me going is working out and training MMA, which is how I ended up doing sales at a gym. The job market is really bad for software engineers and even then, I'm not 100% sure if I want to return to the profession as it still feels unfulfilling. Sales is fun for me but it's not enough shifts so I have to Uber to pay the rest of my bills. Because of that, this whole day I've been driving around professionals going in and out of their jobs and just been feeling like a failure all day. I plan on finding more sales work but currently I'm barely making ends meet to pay my bills and honestly feel like I have no value. I get really down thinking I may never have what I once had or find even a comfortable place financially. And it makes me feel stupider for doing what I did.

u/jeonkoo_,u/jeonkoo_,"i'm 18 and suicidal as i sit here crying in my bed as usual, i've decided to finally reach out to someone just anyone who could possibly see or aknowledge that i'm alive and that i'm also on this planet. I feel incredibly lonely, i have no friends, i don't go to school, i don't work, i don't leave the house. No one knows i exist.

I left my home-country together with my family 3 years ago and left everything behind hoping and wishing for a better life. I didn't have the best lifestyle or a huge group of friends, but i had friends i had school and i had freedom, i had a life. I was happy. I never thought i would end up like this or spend my days taking care of my family and my younger brothers waking up to cleaning all day long to cooking and putting my brothers to sleep. My father is abusive and extremly controlling, i can't leave the house or use my phone during nights etc. the only times i'm allowed to leave the house is when i have to follow him to the grocery store to help with the groceries. I'm not allowed to have social medias or stay in my room for too long. just small details i think anyone would find normal and not weird or ""wrong"". i'm tired of being controlled, i can't decide when i want to shower or when i want to do anything on my own. i used to love art, but i have no time for it anymore. I have no time for my self and there is no point in life.

I ended up in hospital a few months ago when i cut my self pretty deep 3 times in hope that it would frighten or bring any type of attention from my parents but everything is back to normal. I still hurt and cut myself but i know i have to do it somewhere they wouldn't be able to notice otherwise i'm pretty sure they would be very mad and hurt. I used to be very good in school and had so many A's, my dream was to work as a therapist... which is kind of ironic now that i'm searching for one..

i have one friend left that i used to be friends with back in my homecountry, she is my best friend and my only hope in life even though shes depressed as well. She's been starting to go to school more and has more friends and i'm scared that she's going to leave me. She has been getting a bit more distant from me and is usually pretty quiet and busy during calls. i feel so mentally abused by my father, i'm stressed 24/7 and especially around him. I'm scared he's going to find out i have social medias or just anything that could make him get mad or physically abuse me.

I watch as other people my age goes to school, gets jobs, goes out with friends and travels around the world. I won't be able to get a job in the future, i dropped out during middle school and even if i did get a job my father wouldn't let me mostly because i'm a female. I'm too scared to take my life, i'm scared for my younger brothers and that they won't see me as they grow. i'm scared that i will make my parents embarassed and embarass my whole family.

I used to be very good in school and had so many A's, my dream was to work as a therapist... which is kind of ironic now that i'm searching for one..

i have one friend left that i used to be friends with back in my homecountry, she is my best friend and my only hope in life even though shes depressed as well. She's been starting to go to school more and has more friends and i'm scared that she's going to leave me. She has been getting a bit more distant from me and is usually pretty quiet and busy during calls. i feel so mentally abused by my father, i'm stressed 24/7 and especially around him. I'm scared he's going to find out i have social medias or just anything that could make him get mad or physically abuse me.

I watch as other people my age goes to school, gets jobs, goes out with friends and travels around the world. I won't be able to get a job in the future, i dropped out during middle school and even if i did get a job my father wouldn't let me mostly because i'm a female. I'm too scared to take my life, i'm scared for my younger brothers and that they won't see me as they grow. i'm scared that i will make my parents embarassed and embarass my whole family. But i'm constantly thinking about it, i've tried to choke myself and find any rope or any item i could use to unalive myself. I'm not sure where i'm going with this, but i'm very serious about this and i just want to share this, if anyone even would be interested. I think i need help","i can only imagine, must be nice!! hope the best for you <3",1,1,1
u/jeonkoo_,u/jeonkoo_,"i'm 18 and suicidal as i sit here crying in my bed as usual, i've decided to finally reach out to someone just anyone who could possibly see or aknowledge that i'm alive and that i'm also on this planet. I feel incredibly lonely, i have no friends, i don't go to school, i don't work, i don't leave the house. No one knows i exist.

I left my home-country together with my family 3 years ago and left everything behind hoping and wishing for a better life. I didn't have the best lifestyle or a huge group of friends, but i had friends i had school and i had freedom, i had a life. I was happy. I never thought i would end up like this or spend my days taking care of my family and my younger brothers waking up to cleaning all day long to cooking and putting my brothers to sleep. My father is abusive and extremly controlling, i can't leave the house or use my phone during nights etc. the only times i'm allowed to leave the house is when i have to follow him to the grocery store to help with the groceries. I'm not allowed to have social medias or stay in my room for too long. just small details i think anyone would find normal and not weird or ""wrong"". i'm tired of being controlled, i can't decide when i want to shower or when i want to do anything on my own. i used to love art, but i have no time for it anymore. I have no time for my self and there is no point in life.
