u/qtcaela,798,"Tried to kill myself last night - failed and traumatised my mom and dad for life I don‚Äôt really know why I‚Äôm posting this, I guess I feel like people here would understand. I feel so profoundly alone, I know I can talk to my loved ones, but I‚Äôve seen how it breaks their hearts when I tell them how hopeless I feel. So I kept everything to myself and put on fake smiles and happy conversations and (I‚Äôm a recovering alcoholic) didn‚Äôt tell anyone about my relapses etc. I just wanted to be a normal person.

Last night I reached my wits end. I really tried to be better. I tried to keep everyone happy. But I can‚Äôt ignore this deep ache I feel in my heart and soul. An ache that feels like my very existence to the core is not natural, not meant to be there 

So I set up a noose on my curtain rail, wrote a short letter to say goodbye and sorry and got on a chair. My mom walked into my room as I was standing by the curtain and I managed to hide the noose and make an excuse about trying to fix my curtain, she said I should stop being silly and go get dinner, I told her I‚Äôd come just now but she wouldn‚Äôt let up. So.. I just slipped the rope on and jumped off the chair as fast I could. I thought it would kill me fast enough but instead I had my mom trying to hold my body up while I suffocated and my dad trying to cut the rope down with a knife. 

It‚Äôs the next day and I feel a thousand times worse that I put everyone through hell AND couldn‚Äôt even get the job done. I‚Äôm a horrible human being, because despite all of that, I still want nothing more than to stop existing.

u/bezea00,882,"My goodbye letter <3 Hello :) 
I am 24F, from a small country in Europe. I am writing this as I have no one to actually say goodbye to - maybe, just maybe someone will notice this so i can get a farewell. And if anyone is interested, I will talk a bit about myself, because all I wanted was for someone to care..

I want no one to be sad for me, I am going content knowing I actually gave life a shot and tried my best! But I know this is the best solution :( Life is not meant for everyone and that is okay. 

Ever since I was little I had no other purpose than to be mercilessly abused by my teachers and peers and neglected by my parents (I believe they did not mean to, so I have no hard feelings though). 
I was treated as if I was less than human. If something in the class broke, they all agreed to blame it on me. If someone didn‚Äôt wipe the board that day, they‚Äôd say I was on duty so I‚Äôd be the one punished. They‚Äôd also beat me with a chair, push me down the stairs, throw my pencils out the window, step on my clothes so they‚Äôd be dirty, throw food in my face‚Ä¶ you get the idea. At some point kids said if you touched me, you‚Äôd get a virus that made you as stupid and ugly as I was so no one wanted to sit next to me. I get really sad when I see younger pictures of myself :( She was a sweet girl and she didnt deserve that. Every day was like walking on the battlefield, I would pray to God to take me away but he didn‚Äôt want to. I was 11 at most :( My only relief was art, anime, video games and such. Up until 15 I only had online friends on an internet forum back then, and they helped me with loneliness. 

High school was a bit better but I ended up really depressed and spent it battling an eating disorder and not living my years unlike my peers :( My parents didnt notice I was struggling even though I was losing so much weight, they were too attentive to my little brother that had some issues so he needed more help and attention which I understood. But I was left to battle everything alone with no support :( I developed depression, SH issues and an ED. I went to therapy but didn‚Äôt help much :( 

Right now i‚Äôm working with kids, they are cute and I love them but my workplace is really abusive and it brought me to a new low :( it‚Äôs well paid but that doesn‚Äôt help me much. I dread everyday just like I did when I was a kid. I am just living the same sh‚Äôt again and again and cannot change anything. I know if I keep on living it will just be more and more abuse as this is why i was born :( i don‚Äôt know anything else but this. 

Love of my life left me a while ago and he is much better without me. Im too broken to love and be loved. (D, if u ever read this know that I loved u from the bottom of my heart. I am sorry I was not a better gf for you.)

Sadly I cannot feel anything anymore but despair and hopelessness. I left behind all my dreams of being an artist or a sports teacher or a trainer (i really love working out) sadly I chose psychology to study and I cannot change it anymore nor study something else :( I don‚Äôt even have the energy left anymore anyway. 

I really hope my parents will take care of my cats, two strays I saved and raised from since they were the size of my palm. Maxine and Sissi, you kept me alive for a little more and you are the light of my life ü§ç I will remember your shiny, emerald eyes, your soft fur, and you purring on my chest as I pass away. 

I had so much love to give sadly I didn‚Äôt know how to give and receive , and I am also really scared of people deep down :( I dont know how to fit in and never knew. I tried to change my life inside and outside, I really tried it all. But now my soul is really worn out :( 
I would like to thank everyone who kept me alive for a little longer, anyone who ever tried even in the slightest to encourage me, and saw even the littlest potential in me.

u/bezea00,882,"My goodbye letter <3 Hello :) 
I am 24F, from a small country in Europe. I am writing this as I have no one to actually say goodbye to - maybe, just maybe someone will notice this so i can get a farewell. And if anyone is interested, I will talk a bit about myself, because all I wanted was for someone to care..

I want no one to be sad for me, I am going content knowing I actually gave life a shot and tried my best! But I know this is the best solution :( Life is not meant for everyone and that is okay. 

Ever since I was little I had no other purpose than to be mercilessly abused by my teachers and peers and neglected by my parents (I believe they did not mean to, so I have no hard feelings though). 
I was treated as if I was less than human. If something in the class broke, they all agreed to blame it on me. If someone didn‚Äôt wipe the board that day, they‚Äôd say I was on duty so I‚Äôd be the one punished. They‚Äôd also beat me with a chair, push me down the stairs, throw my pencils out the window, step on my clothes so they‚Äôd be dirty, throw food in my face‚Ä¶ you get the idea. At some point kids said if you touched me, you‚Äôd get a virus that made you as stupid and ugly as I was so no one wanted to sit next to me. I get really sad when I see younger pictures of myself :( She was a sweet girl and she didnt deserve that. Every day was like walking on the battlefield, I would pray to God to take me away but he didn‚Äôt want to. I was 11 at most :( My only relief was art, anime, video games and such. Up until 15 I only had online friends on an internet forum back then, and they helped me with loneliness. 

High school was a bit better but I ended up really depressed and spent it battling an eating disorder and not living my years unlike my peers :( My parents didnt notice I was struggling even though I was losing so much weight, they were too attentive to my little brother that had some issues so he needed more help and attention which I understood. But I was left to battle everything alone with no support :( I developed depression, SH issues and an ED. I went to therapy but didn‚Äôt help much :( 

Right now i‚Äôm working with kids, they are cute and I love them but my workplace is really abusive and it brought me to a new low :( it‚Äôs well paid but that doesn‚Äôt help me much. I dread everyday just like I did when I was a kid. I am just living the same sh‚Äôt again and again and cannot change anything. I know if I keep on living it will just be more and more abuse as this is why i was born :( i don‚Äôt know anything else but this. 

Love of my life left me a while ago and he is much better without me. Im too broken to love and be loved. (D, if u ever read this know that I loved u from the bottom of my heart. I am sorry I was not a better gf for you.)

Sadly I cannot feel anything anymore but despair and hopelessness. I left behind all my dreams of being an artist or a sports teacher or a trainer (i really love working out) sadly I chose psychology to study and I cannot change it anymore nor study something else :( I don‚Äôt even have the energy left anymore anyway. 

I really hope my parents will take care of my cats, two strays I saved and raised from since they were the size of my palm. Maxine and Sissi, you kept me alive for a little more and you are the light of my life ü§ç I will remember your shiny, emerald eyes, your soft fur, and you purring on my chest as I pass away. 

I had so much love to give sadly I didn‚Äôt know how to give and receive , and I am also really scared of people deep down :( I dont know how to fit in and never knew. I tried to change my life inside and outside, I really tried it all. But now my soul is really worn out :( 
I would like to thank everyone who kept me alive for a little longer, anyone who ever tried even in the slightest to encourage me, and saw even the littlest potential in me. 
I am sorry I bit like a scared dog the hands of people who tried to help because I couldn‚Äôt distinguish anymore who was and who wasn‚Äôt well-meaning.

For now, I'm in the stage of acquiring the materials and getting my affairs in order.

  
Since I got my suicide method figured out, I'm in a strangely upbeat mood. 

It's an odd paradox. Finalizing my plan of action to end my life made me feel motivated to go out and live it. I'm getting chores done with no sweat, I'm dancing and listening to fun music, I'm gaining bits of my personality back. A great weight has been lifted off my shoulders.

From what I heard, it's common for people to act calm or joyful the days before they make an attempt. Is that what I'm experiencing? Maybe it's because I have a goal now? Like my days don't feel meaningless like they persistently have? Or maybe finally there's an escape route to break free from the shitshow that is my life. I don't feel as trapped and hopeless anymore.
