However! I recently changed my job, I was so down I was in the “fuck it, what can I lose?” Mindset and it (almost annoyingly?) worked.. I ‘liked’ my old job and I liked the people I was working with, they arguably saved my life some days, but I was just like.. what else is there? Just do it mate, just get on linked in and apply for shit for fun. Apply for things you’re not even entirely sure what it’s about lol - what do you have to lose?? The job I’m in now is something I never ever dreamed I’d be in. It’s not even that amazing, almost relatively boring, but I’m enjoying the boredom for once. It’s almost funny to me, I’m getting paid more for much much less responsibilities and way more freedom. I’m loving learning new things. I’m loving that I can actually be good at something I’ve only been doing a few weeks and I didn’t even know existed until recently. Just flip your life upside down mate. If it doesn’t work out? Just look again..

Also I’ve been trying to think back to stuff I used to do when I was younger and felt a bit more ‘free’, yet had no money to do things so had to entertain myself. I used to live near the sea when I was a kid and loved every min it’s if it, so now I try to go sea swimming again. It’s free, good for you, loads of health benefits and mental benefits and it’s not something ‘new’, I’m just telling myself that I used to like it so why wouldn’t I now? Is there anything you can think of that you liked to do when you were a kid? 

Get comfortable doing things by yourself. My anxiety fucks me over with this one a lot, but you gotta remind yourself that literally nobody gives a fuck and nobody cares and you’ll never see them again so, why not? Go for that walk in the woods. Climb a fkin tree. Look for bugs 🐛. Go to a shop just to look around. You don’t like the world? Then fuck em, just do you. 

I still have a very very long way to go mind you, and I’m saying this like I go and do these things frequently - I really don’t, I’m a depressed anxious ball of shit most of the time BUT all I know is that when I do go and do this stuff, I feel a tiny bit better. 

Sometimes I get real sad cause I’m doing these things alone, or going through life feeling like this alone.

Depression is truly a mental illness, and progressing through therapy is hard work.

Talk to someone. There are often free resources and/or support groups. I know there are some for SA victims. 


If self-talk or pessimism is a problem, retrain your brain. Dissociate your normal self from your depression. It's hard, but it helps a lot. When I start to get sudden strong pessimistic feelings or strongly negative self-talk, I realize now that is not me, but the Depression talking and depression exaggerates a lot. I can now discard that thought and either evaluate what has my mood down or distract myself until the wave passes. Don't allow your Depression to talk you in hurtful ways, just like you wouldn't keep a friend who does that to you. Remember that lashing out is just a defense mechanism for hurt. Why are you hurting? Talk it out. 


Find something you enjoy. Maybe it's a local trivia night, or a club, a game night with friends, or a walk in the park. Anything on a regular basis that brings you joy and leaves you with joy afterward (in a healthy way), or at a minimum, allows you to forget your problems for a time.

ESPECIALLY family.  They are the worst betrayers of all.  They abandon and minimize and ignore anytime I try and talk.

Not to mention they're the source of most of my original trauma.

Instead of helping they just try and do insane controlling things and pretend to help, while signalling everyone they can at how they're helping, but they don't even go through the basic necessary pre-requisites for help like communication and understanding first, so it ends up hurting and only serves their needs in the end.  It's ridiculous.

I try and say that I want to spend more time with them, do things, just be around 'people' and that I have problems communicating my thoughts and feelings because I don't trust anyone anymore... and they tell me either go see a therapist or go to some bullcrap toastmasters meeting or to volunteer somewhere or some other random stuff they spent 2 seconds thinking about just to try and get rid of me.

And was living st my parents house from 30-36. I was born with a lot of medical issues and at 32 was approved for ssdi, or disability. I then learned they expected me to live off of 1200$/month for the rest of my life. So not only had I spent 5 years+ of my life in hospitals, 5 major surgeries to remove pieces of diseased intestines, couldn't hold down a job, relationship, finish college. I ended up getting addicted to the pain meds I was constantly prescribed, and I wanted to die. Had you asked me when I was 31, where I'd be at 41, I would have said dead.

I'm now 41m, and engaged to the absolute love of my life. My now fiancee is 31f, and we both work in the video game industry, at the same company now. We got really really really lucky. She went from a 32k/yr 3d modeling job at an architecture firm, to her dream job of being an 3d enviornment artist on video games. She cleared 6 figures for the first time ever in 2023. When I saw how life changing that was for her, and us, I started trying harder. When I was young and sick all the time, I taught myself how to build computers at the age of 8. It was mostly a hobby, but I kept applying to IT positions at video game developers. I even applied for a position that opened up where she works, and got denied the first time. Then 6 months later another entry level contract position opened up, and i applied again. I nailed the interview, and have been out pacing the 25-30 year olds for the past 2 years now. 

I have been sober for 8 years, which is amazing. On top of that were BOTH set to make around 6 figures this year. She makes a bit more than me, but I'm catching up. 

I feel like I'm so so behind though. I've never had a house, I've never had retirement savings. I've always driven 2-3,000$ cars my parents helped me get, or hand me downs with 150k+ on them. We just bought our first new car, a tesla! We have a wonderful apartment, two cats, and get to go on cruises/vacations 2 to 3 times a year. Our wedding is set for March 2025. 

I've learned many many lessons in my roller coaster of a life. I've learned that a plan is necessary, sticking to it more so. I've learned you can try, and do the right thing, over and over and over, and stillget the short end of the stick. That's life and its shit. However the only way to truly fail in this one life we get, is to stop trying. Then you're garunteed to fail. I kept going, despite giving up on many occasions, even wanted to end it on a few of those really bad days. I'm glad I didn't. 

I could have never ever ever ever imagined I would be where I am currently at. I met the right person that understands all of my weirdness and medical issues. She changed everything, and showed me what an amazing life I could have. Some days it's hard because I'm a medically disabled 40 year old working with 23-35 year olds. I now hit 15,000 steps a day running around our game studios 5 story office building, every day. My medical issues have become less of a worry. I've noticed now that alot of my mental issues have gone away, and that has made my life so much more liveable. I come home and pass out for an hour or two each day, so it's exhausting, but I LOVE it. I used to live off 1200$/month and thought that was going to be the rest of my life, alone. 

I now have a best friend, an amazing person I never thought I'd have, and I make 1200$+/wk now. It can happen, things can change.

I suffered a black eye but other than bruises I'm good. 

I'm doing my best to get to college and get a scholarship but with recent events it's getting harder and harder I can barely catch up with my online studies, because I need to ration the remaining allowance I have from being a part time Make up artist.

Every time I end up feeling ""better"" my depression comes back worse and worse sooner or later. The self harming gets worse The thoughts of ending it all persist.

So.. what I'm trying to say is... I'm unfortunately still alive, and I still wish I wasn't.

I'm still holding on, somehow. Lots of you have helped.

...When my mom passed i had to take care of my dad, when my dad passed i took care of my granny for a couple months til i got my low income place, & it was my first time in over a year & a half with no one to take care of, first time living alone & first time having to find my own daily routine in life, & it was at that point i lost it mentally & emotionally.

I've come to realise that they're just not equipped to deal with it. All this mental health awareness ""reach out to a friend"" advice is terrible, it comes from a place of such poor mental health support in many countries and trying to put the responsibility on your friends and family, and it's dangerous.

Don't do that. I got a better offer for you.

Get up off the roof.  Get your foot out the grave.

Now walk away. Walk away from everything.  If you wanna pack a bag, ok. If not, ok too.

Take off walking.  Hit the road Jack.

Toss your ID away,  pick a new name and set off on an adventure. 

What do you have to lose? In the other scenario you are dead. It may seem scary and risky but so is the alternative.  

Hitch hike, meet new people, go from one town to another.  If you're on the west head east,  if youre on east then go west.

There's plenty of land to travel so don't stay too long in one place. Meet the locals, get a cash job, bartender,  server, construction,  harvest crops, fisher, boat hand, whatever. There's plenty of ways to make the cash you need to get by.

You can start without money, without anything,  just go.

See the sites. You have absolutely nothing to lose. You're dead anyways. So it doesn't matter.

Live life on the fringe. Most important,  live life. I promise death will arrive for you on time when it's supposed.  Like for all of us.

Ok, I hope you seen this. I hope you see it as a better but equal alternative.  You still disappear from your life that you have now. The old you is dead but the new you, whoever that is, you pick, is hitting the road. 

When you hit Texas, hit me up, we'll get a drink and you can tell me how it's going. 

Ok my friend,  that's my advice.  I pray you get moving and let a new beginning start right now.
