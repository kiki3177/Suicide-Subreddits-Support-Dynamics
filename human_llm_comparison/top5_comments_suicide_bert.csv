u/OneAlive9524,2152,"Penis was destroyed by a doctor exam. I don't know how much more I can take I've been living in a nightmare for 4 months and I just want it to end so badly.  4 months ago my life was destroyed by what I thought would be a simple urologist check up.  It was definitely not that.  He ""examined"" my penis extremely roughly and stretched it very hard and crushed it.  Ever since my penis has been completely numb with total erectile dysfunction.  I suffer every moment of the day feeling a numb pressure uncomfortableness in my penis that makes it impossible to sleep and relax.  It drives me so crazy I sometimes I sometimes just want to cut it off for relief which is something I would never want.  I'm only 33 years old and I will never be able to feel or use my penis again.  The doctor damaged my bulbocavernosous muscle/nerve in my penis which is responsible for erections and ejaculations.  This muscle is extremely numb and lifeless now like the rest of my penis.

Nobody cares or believes me when I tell them what happened.  Doctors or lawyers.  I've been to several doctors and they don't know what to do.  They just gaslight me and say it might be psychological when it definitely is not.  I literally can't feel my penis at all anymore.  Not hot, cold, touch, pain, pressure, nothing.  It's completely numb.  My scrotum and penis are very cold to the touch 24/7.  I stay on high dose Cialis to see if it helps and it does nothing at all.  My penis stays numb and jelly like always.

I've reported the uro to the hospital and medical board snd nothing happened.  People tell me things like I need to be strong and get over it.  Or your penis isn't everything.  It's so easy for someone else to say that.  They don't know how miserable it is.  I have no desire getting gaslit by more doctors, lawyers, or anyone else at this point.",1,2,1,u/portscanangriff,415,"If it helps, I believe you and don‚Äôt want you to stop fighting for your rights.

At like 25ish she totally turned her life around. She decided not to allow the past to control her future.

I am 24F, from a small country in Europe. I am writing this as I have no one to actually say goodbye to - maybe, just maybe someone will notice this so i can get a farewell. And if anyone is interested, I will talk a bit about myself, because all I wanted was for someone to care..

I want no one to be sad for me, I am going content knowing I actually gave life a shot and tried my best! But I know this is the best solution :( Life is not meant for everyone and that is okay. 

Ever since I was little I had no other purpose than to be mercilessly abused by my teachers and peers and neglected by my parents (I believe they did not mean to, so I have no hard feelings though). 
I was treated as if I was less than human. If something in the class broke, they all agreed to blame it on me. If someone didn‚Äôt wipe the board that day, they‚Äôd say I was on duty so I‚Äôd be the one punished. They‚Äôd also beat me with a chair, push me down the stairs, throw my pencils out the window, step on my clothes so they‚Äôd be dirty, throw food in my face‚Ä¶ you get the idea. At some point kids said if you touched me, you‚Äôd get a virus that made you as stupid and ugly as I was so no one wanted to sit next to me. I get really sad when I see younger pictures of myself :( She was a sweet girl and she didnt deserve that. Every day was like walking on the battlefield, I would pray to God to take me away but he didn‚Äôt want to. I was 11 at most :( My only relief was art, anime, video games and such. Up until 15 I only had online friends on an internet forum back then, and they helped me with loneliness. 

High school was a bit better but I ended up really depressed and spent it battling an eating disorder and not living my years unlike my peers :( My parents didnt notice I was struggling even though I was losing so much weight, they were too attentive to my little brother that had some issues so he needed more help and attention which I understood. But I was left to battle everything alone with no support :( I developed depression, SH issues and an ED. I went to therapy but didn‚Äôt help much :( 

Right now i‚Äôm working with kids, they are cute and I love them but my workplace is really abusive and it brought me to a new low :( it‚Äôs well paid but that doesn‚Äôt help me much. I dread everyday just like I did when I was a kid. I am just living the same sh‚Äôt again and again and cannot change anything. I know if I keep on living it will just be more and more abuse as this is why i was born :( i don‚Äôt know anything else but this. 

Love of my life left me a while ago and he is much better without me. Im too broken to love and be loved. (D, if u ever read this know that I loved u from the bottom of my heart. I am sorry I was not a better gf for you.)

Sadly I cannot feel anything anymore but despair and hopelessness. I left behind all my dreams of being an artist or a sports teacher or a trainer (i really love working out) sadly I chose psychology to study and I cannot change it anymore nor study something else :( I don‚Äôt even have the energy left anymore anyway. 

I really hope my parents will take care of my cats, two strays I saved and raised from since they were the size of my palm. Maxine and Sissi, you kept me alive for a little more and you are the light of my life ü§ç I will remember your shiny, emerald eyes, your soft fur, and you purring on my chest as I pass away. 

I had so much love to give sadly I didn‚Äôt know how to give and receive , and I am also really scared of people deep down :( I dont know how to fit in and never knew. I tried to change my life inside and outside, I really tried it all. But now my soul is really worn out :(

I was treated as if I was less than human. If something in the class broke, they all agreed to blame it on me. If someone didn‚Äôt wipe the board that day, they‚Äôd say I was on duty so I‚Äôd be the one punished. They‚Äôd also beat me with a chair, push me down the stairs, throw my pencils out the window, step on my clothes so they‚Äôd be dirty, throw food in my face‚Ä¶ you get the idea. At some point kids said if you touched me, you‚Äôd get a virus that made you as stupid and ugly as I was so no one wanted to sit next to me. I get really sad when I see younger pictures of myself :( She was a sweet girl and she didnt deserve that. Every day was like walking on the battlefield, I would pray to God to take me away but he didn‚Äôt want to. I was 11 at most :( My only relief was art, anime, video games and such. Up until 15 I only had online friends on an internet forum back then, and they helped me with loneliness. 

High school was a bit better but I ended up really depressed and spent it battling an eating disorder and not living my years unlike my peers :( My parents didnt notice I was struggling even though I was losing so much weight, they were too attentive to my little brother that had some issues so he needed more help and attention which I understood. But I was left to battle everything alone with no support :( I developed depression, SH issues and an ED. I went to therapy but didn‚Äôt help much :( 

Right now i‚Äôm working with kids, they are cute and I love them but my workplace is really abusive and it brought me to a new low :( it‚Äôs well paid but that doesn‚Äôt help me much. I dread everyday just like I did when I was a kid. I am just living the same sh‚Äôt again and again and cannot change anything. I know if I keep on living it will just be more and more abuse as this is why i was born :( i don‚Äôt know anything else but this. 

Love of my life left me a while ago and he is much better without me. Im too broken to love and be loved. (D, if u ever read this know that I loved u from the bottom of my heart. I am sorry I was not a better gf for you.)

Sadly I cannot feel anything anymore but despair and hopelessness. I left behind all my dreams of being an artist or a sports teacher or a trainer (i really love working out) sadly I chose psychology to study and I cannot change it anymore nor study something else :( I don‚Äôt even have the energy left anymore anyway. 

I really hope my parents will take care of my cats, two strays I saved and raised from since they were the size of my palm. Maxine and Sissi, you kept me alive for a little more and you are the light of my life ü§ç I will remember your shiny, emerald eyes, your soft fur, and you purring on my chest as I pass away. 

I had so much love to give sadly I didn‚Äôt know how to give and receive , and I am also really scared of people deep down :( I dont know how to fit in and never knew. I tried to change my life inside and outside, I really tried it all. But now my soul is really worn out :( 
I would like to thank everyone who kept me alive for a little longer, anyone who ever tried even in the slightest to encourage me, and saw even the littlest potential in me. 
I am sorry I bit like a scared dog the hands of people who tried to help because I couldn‚Äôt distinguish anymore who was and who wasn‚Äôt well-meaning. I am so sorry :( I have many regrets in this life too, all them being I wasn‚Äôt a better person to the very little people who loved me. In my last moments, I hope they can forgive me and visit my grave or think about me from time to time. I am sending everyone so much love and gratitude, it was a difficult journey and a really painful one too. I think my soul has learned a lot in this painful lifetime. But it is enough.

Since I got my suicide method figured out, I'm in a strangely upbeat mood. 

It's an odd paradox. Finalizing my plan of action to end my life made me feel motivated to go out and live it. I'm getting chores done with no sweat, I'm dancing and listening to fun music, I'm gaining bits of my personality back. A great weight has been lifted off my shoulders.

From what I heard, it's common for people to act calm or joyful the days before they make an attempt. Is that what I'm experiencing? Maybe it's because I have a goal now? Like my days don't feel meaningless like they persistently have? Or maybe finally there's an escape route to break free from the shitshow that is my life. I don't feel as trapped and hopeless anymore.
