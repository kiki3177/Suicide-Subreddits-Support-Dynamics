Accepting emotions doesn't mean dwelling on or succumbing to them, but rather to not beat yourself up over feeling them and letting them come as they are, feel them without resisting and then letting them go.

Feelings are as fleeting as time, anger is similar to fear in many ways, it's extremely primal and clouds your judgement. The fact that you notice the destructive pattern of the intensity of your anger definitely places you ahead of those who don't.

But don't think these emotions define you, you obviously don't want to harm anyone and seemingly haven't, strive to keep that going and try to spot when you're angry and calm down when you do, reminding yourself of the consequenses of letting it brew within you.

u/jotspot,1,"> it's not like there is any failure in the institution as a whole.

I do beg to differ on this, not from a therapy standpoint but from an overall medical care standpoint. I've waited a dozen years for psychiatry.... Even went to the ER while I was psychotic post-attempt and was refused. But therapy just felt like.... I dunno, like I was doing something wrong. I never could pinpoint it.

> maybe you have no idea that some of the trauma you've experienced is not only unusual, maybe it's highly unusual and you need more specialized care. 

Most people were abused as kids... I know I'm not special. But I was told I was not capable of doing trauma therapy (IE: too sick for it) by the only therapist I ever had for more than a few sessions....

>  A good therapist will suggest ways to manage your thoughts and feelings that maybe you haven't tried before.

Hmmm....But then doesn't that just mean that I am not even in the right place? I don't need thought management. I just need a justifiable reason to exist...

I think everything you've said is good and helpful to understand. I don't really have anyone to talk to ever, on any basis. There is no friends, family or SO, just as it has been that way for more than half my life....but it seems super silly for me to pay someone to ""care"" about things....am I reading that wrong? I'm convinced there is 2 things wrong: 1) I don't have enough brain chemicals (I'm bipolar). and 2) I legitimately have reasons to be depressed. I don't think it's all just some failing of my own. I am not depressed all because of ""triggers"" or something. Sure that can hurt, but depression is caused for me by fundamental unresolvable problems. I've been depressed since I was maybe 5 years old, and all along people always said ""it get's better"" without an explanation as to ""how"" things get better, so it didn't.

-Drink water.
-Exercise, even if all you can do is a walk to the letterbox. To.orrow, aim for the neighbours letterbox, and so on. Increase as it feels comfortable to you.
-When you find yourself standing or sitting idle, do a few squats or something similar. It's not much but over time it counts and it helps you feel like you have done something productive. No matter how small.
-Start a diary and every day write things you are grateful for. It helps give you perspective when things feel useless.
-Set small daily goals that you WANT to do, Not thatbyou HAVE to do. If you complete them, that's great. If not, tomorrow is another opportunity.
-Don't give yourself a timeframe on when you should feel ""normal"" again.
