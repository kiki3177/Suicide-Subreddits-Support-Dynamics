The friendly lady offered her services for honest compensation. It was consensual! No one was harmed. You needed it in that moment. In my country (Germany) it's even a unionized profession with seminars and mandatory bi-annual medical check-ups. 

Neither of you two are in my eyes bad people. To me it's no different than going to a Massage Parlor or Nail Salon.  
Just a bit more sexier.

It is the oldest profession.

Btw. Back when I used to do porn for a studio and work as a call boy, I even quite enjoyed it.

You did nothing wrong in my eyes and life is full of crazy shit. A roller coaster of emotions with dips and valleys. You just had a profound valley and needed relief, that's normal... You're just a human.

I mean, if you want the religious Christian route:

Did Jesus love the adulteress and the prostitute? Absolutely. There are two remarkable stories showing how Jesus cared for all types of people. The religious folks called the¬†*Pharisees*¬†in the time of Jesus were offended, because in their view God loved only the righteous who kept the law. They therefore distanced themselves from so-called 'unclean' sinners in their delusions of self-righteousness.

But Jesus was often eating and drinking with corrupt tax collectors and other disreputable sinners. He met people where they were and healed them. In addition, Jesus proclaimed that both law-keepers and law-breakers are sinners in need of forgiveness. How could this be?

Jesus understood that humans are flawed, that no one is infallible. Even the nicest and seemingly flawless people  
make mistakes in eyes of god.   
  
So if this still weighs heavily on your religious upbringing and conscious, keep in mind that you did nothing unforgivable and that Jesus and god loves you.  
  
And from my atheist perspective:  
  
Shit happens bro. You did nothing wrong. You're a human like me and others here and you have the same needs and desires as we do. Neither she or you are a bad person for that.",1,1,1

[deleted],1,"I'd urge you to consider carefully.

Think of life like a lone videogame in your collection. It may frustrate you and make you wish to rip out your heart when you play it, but you only have one chance at playing it. There are no second playthroughs, no alternative games to play, and no other experiences to consider. You're just here with the game, which by laws of scarcity is just about the most valuable opportunity you have metaphysically. On a grand scale your two main options are to either exist and play out the game or to not exist and give up on it all entirely.

So I'd recommend that you do as you do with any game, pick up the controller and start trying to play it as you intrinsically wish. Get achievements whilst also enjoying the pleasures of life in moderation. Get a higher score for the life your unique playthrough of life. Extract the value out of life.



I don't know the specifics of your situation. It's possible that you can accomplish more than you believe due to skewed perspective. However, if I take your word that you have no future, love, or ability to achieve the lofty goals society centers around; there is still things you can do. Goals to accomplish to make your final score when you leave a bit higher. To comfort yourself when you do take the plunge willingly or not.

It can be something small. Like properly thanking those who have helped you, or saying hello to your neighbor. But it can grow further from there. Think of the various things that you are too scared of doing and ask that if you were to die tomorrow, if you'd feel comfortable not even trying to get some moderately challenging things done.

Like finding a job where you are valued, creating a piece of art (like a short story), getting some muscles, and whatnot. Just whatever you can do to make you feel like you're getting proper value out of the game of life.

You can put the past a bit further back and think about what you could be doing in the moment. Taking the past years as a backdrop to the now, like the prologue of a game. Sure, time has past, but I'm sure there's still things big or small you can grasp onto to get a bit more before you decide to go away into nonexistence, where there is nothing. No nothingness to experience, no visages to enjoy, or anything at all. Just the same existence as an eaten breadstick.",2,2,2
