Whenever I really want to talk with someone about my situation my brain gets all muddy. Talking and playing games with friends keeps me grounded and sane, but since I haven't done my homework I can't get on. If I don't have my friends to keep me sane, then it's nearly impossible for me to focus on anything but the noise. The intrusive thoughts of hurting/killing my parents are a daily occurence now. I can't think straight. It's in my head I just wish I could just cut it out. I dont care if I have to get a knife and cut it out myself I just want it gone. I'm sorry if this is disjointed but I can't focus on one issue even with a relatively clear head. The loneliness kills me every day too. I don't have anyone I truely love or can contact for help.

I guess this anecdote is something about how the past doesn't exist (per se), and what we have to work with is the present? I'm not really sure, and I know that nothing I say will erase years of trauma, but I hope it helps a little.

And so what if everyone thinks you're a special needs person? For everyone you've met, that's a person you have the opportunity to impress. And for everyone you haven't met (which is really quite a big number) that's another first impression! I'm not saying there won't be work involved; there's still improving the facets of yourself you don't like and finding people who accept the facets of yourself you do, but it's not a lost cause.

I've had a few times in my life where I was at the breaking point. I have started attempts but never successfully went through with it, I had the intention but was either stopped by my own brain or someone else or simply too stupid to make it work.

I have started spiraling hard recently but I have always managed to get myself out of that deep dark hole I'd put myself in. So most of the time it does get better with time. I can tell you what works for me but I can't promise you that it will for you. 

Developing a healthy routine, including sports, hobbies, healthy foods and lots of social time is what tends to work for me.

It's possible that your friend is just venting, and often times talking about intentions actually reduces motivation to carry them out, so it may be that the venting is helping J in a weird backwards kind of way.  But it's fine to say that you're worried about them and to ask them flat out if they're really thinking about trying to end their life.  It's definitely *not* okay to tell them how stupid it is!  The thing to remember is that the best way to help someone feel less suicidal immediately is to give them the experience of feeling understood.  Telling someone that what they're thinking is stupid will do the exact opposite of that.
