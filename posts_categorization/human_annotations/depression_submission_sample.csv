u/puikachung,23,"I feel like crying all the time, and I don't know who to tell. I feel awful and want to cry most of the time, I have never seen a doctor ,so apart from knowing that I am sad, I don't know what's wrong with me.
It can be my first feeling when I wake up in the morning , it can come from no where or just because of a bad memory slip in my mind. Once it happened , I can not stop thinking of every horrible things in the past, and I will start hating myself by not being strong. When I am in a bad mental situation, I can physically notice that I can't concentrate anything around me, I can hear noises but I can't 'hear' or understand whoever is talking to me at that moment .
I don't have friends because I am scared of social life, after witness how people in the houses party just wanted something from each other makes me feel sick (next time I will tell more abt the house party things ), I avoid people more than ever.
English is not my first language ,so the only time I call the free helpline didnt went so well coz I couldn't completely understand the conversation.

Fortunately I am not alone at the moment , I have a boyfriend living with me and we are a beautiful interracial couple. Though a lot of bad things happened in this relationship last one and a half year, but we have learnd to get through and grow up. Just when my relationship started to get stronger, I have to face the coming future time we both needs to go back to our own country and might never meet again.

I also feel so bad because my mom only wants me to go back home, she won't accept my relationship so I didn't tell her anything the whole time. Somehow I want to blame my mom has to take my away from my love but I feel so guity even just have a thought .
I love my mom so much but to her everything I do is wrong and it should be perfect that's how I grew up. 
My dad is sick so he can't work and can't even think normal anymore, and my grandpa just found out that he has cancer . My mom definitely being through so much more than me ,so I can't blame anyone for whatever had happened in my life.
Sometimes I just hated myself so much, I am not success , I can't give my mom what she wants,  I can't keep me and my partner together , I can't let them know how sad I am coz I don't want my emotion to affect them, I am not good at socialis so when I need help I don't even have a friend.
Sometimes I just sleep myself to death so that I don't need to feel the stress and insecurity .
I don't have appetite most of the time, so I get skinner and looks unhealthy. I am scared of hurt, so time I just keep imaging how people's gonna hurt me and how I can fight back, afterall I just feel upset inside me and exhausted until I sleep.

this is my first time post in here, just hope I can somehow feel better after type it out.",1,1,1

This weekend my dog was having a hard time getting up and downstairs, sleeping much deeper, and just seemed to generally be slowing down. 

I spent all Sunday morning crying about her, and a large portion of Monday too.

She's still here, seems relatively ok just slower, a tad more achy than usual, and is in good health considering she's almost 13. And yet the meer thought of saying goodbye to her drove me to tears for hours. Not necessarily hysterical but definitely out and out crying mixed with general leaking.

Does this sound like something normal or should I see my GP?

When my mom asked me if I did my hw I decided I would be honest and I told her she was super pissed and instead of doing what we agreed on she took my phone (my only way of communicating with friends ) which my doctor said I should be talking with them 5-6 times a week and said that if my grades don't get better there will be more consequences this has made me want to improve way less and I feel like the trust I put in her is broken and if stuff doesn't get better she'll prob take away my computer which is my main source of happiness I'm pretty fucked and everything is getting worse.,2,1,1

I never wanted to in the first place, but since August, the only reason I had left not to shoot myself left me. I have nothing left. I have no future. I have no desire to live. I have no motivation to do anything but give up. The only thing that's kept me alive since August is a combination of not being alone long enough to shoot myself and being scared of how it will feel and what will happen afterwards, but now I'm gradually becoming so indifferent to that last part that soon enough I just won't care.

School is draining and I no longer want to try and if it wasn’t for the fact that I have group projects to do and feel more guilty for not contributing, I might have just given up for sure.

I don’t have the discipline or the willpower to hold myself accountable for my assignments and I keep getting waves of depression at random times for varying lengths and I can’t get anything done. When I actually went to school I got things done because I was scared of letting my teachers down or having people know I didn’t do my assignments but that doesn’t work in quarantine. 

Every time I feel like I’m getting myself together and I finally clean my disgusting room that I’ve trashed the past couple days, another wave of depression hits me and then I’m back to being absolutely useless. I was so so happy yesterday and today I’m so stressed and I can’t do anything and I was thinking it could be because I’m a bit sleep deprived so I tried to take a nap but I couldn’t because of my anxiety. 

I explained to two of my teachers who reached out to me first and they were both very understanding and one of them gave me this website thing that I can contact our school’s mental health counselor through (it’s like a video chatting thing) but I don’t know how to work it and it feels like every time I try to contact her, I’m feeling happy again so I tell myself I’m doing fine and I don’t need to contact her. She only has a three hour window Monday-Thursday too so I can’t just contact her when I’m feeling sad. 

I haven’t done any assignments the past two weeks and my grades and going to drop so much and I’m so scared. I don’t know what to do. I wish I had a therapist or something but I’m hesitant to get one because I want to join the military (which could be a terrible idea but I want to do it) and I don’t want it to get in the way. I’ve had one before but she told me there was no need for us to meet anymore because I was fine now. Obviously I’m not fine.

I feel like I’ve lost contact with everyone. I barely talk to anyone from school. I’m just avoiding talking to people but I feel so alone at the same time.

u/blanitk,0,"My Fucking Terrible Sin I’m 18 and a senior in high school, life is just dog shit, exactly 3 years ago soon after I got my learner license is when everything went downhill. It was literally only 8 days after I got my license when it was my mother’s birthday. I wanted to do her a small treat and drive her and the family to Applebee’s and even pay for it with my allowance. We live in a city so we had to take the big ass highway to get to any restaurants, the speed limit was real high, 90 mph I believe and it was my first time going that fast. I remember being nervous driving in such traffic. We were about to enter the exit off the highway to get to the restaurant when this dumbass lady forced herself in my lane because she was about to miss the exit, I panicked and lost control of the car going so fast and we swerved into the concrete walls that are on the side and I blacked out right when we hit, I don’t remember anything but I faintly remember waking up and passing back out from the pain all over my body, I remembered looking around briefly during those transitions between waking up and passing out wondering why my dad wasn’t in the passenger seat. I guess at the time I was hoping he got out and went for help, I didn’t look behind me at all, probably best I didn’t at the time. I remember waking up in the hospital at night, it was dark, and I had no clue what was going on, I was scared, and I couldn’t feel a thing, I couldn’t talk even though I wanted to scream. It felt like an eternity of being stuck in this loop of wondering what the fuck happened and not feeling anything. Getting to the point, after spending a lot of time in the hospital I was eventually okay enough to talk and work with the nurses and doctors, I had multiple surgeries, I had a very bad brain bleed, my right arm was completely shattered, multiple broken ribs, my jaw was broken, collar bone and left leg were broke too. I’d imagine the doctors knew I had gone through a lot so they waited a while to tell me the bad news, after I don’t even know how long, they finally told me when all my Surgeries were preformed and I was in the process of healing that my family died. My mother died from terrible head trauma and never even made it to the hospital, my dad didn’t wear his seatbelt and was ejected going who knows how fast and died on impact. My little sister was crushed to death in the back at some point during the roll of the car. I don’t even know how I fucking lived. I spent those agonizing weeks in the hospital knowing what happened and I was in so much fucking pain mentally and physically. Eventually I was sent to my uncles who only lived 40 mins away and continued to heal. It felt like years, in that span of probably a month from learning everyone died I felt so lost. It was terrible, I was alone, in pain and suffered every second. I eventually was healed enough to be able to go to therapy which I still go to today, it was painful learning how to do basic things that I couldn’t do anymore. Every second I thought of my family and wish I wasn’t alive. I had no motivation, to wake up and get better. It was already almost impossible to get around the house on my own and I couldn’t stop thinking about mom, dad, and my sweet little sister. I couldn’t sleep I couldn’t eat and it still fucking haunts me to this day, yeah I got much better since than physically but my mind is going crazy, my uncle directed me to therapy which I go to often, but it doesn’t help. I see them every second every day and I have for the last three years. I’m a fucking murderer. They died because I couldn’t drive like a normal person. I can’t stand doing anything anymore. My life had been ruined, I transferred schools, I can’t do Sports anymore, school is fucking hell, I don’t see my old friends because they’re outta town, I have no friends here and I’m just looked at as the depressed kid. It’s unbearable, I fight these demons everyday and I can’t stop seeing their goddamn faces. I just want them back, I want my life back. This virus has me locked up and it’s even worse, I don’t do anything, I’m trapped in this house and what little of my sanity that I had before is gone. I’m a evil person, I killed my family and I’m a sinner, I don’t want to live anymore, it’s daily torture and I’m being haunted by my family. It’s like my senses feel them, I hear them, I can smell them and I can almost feel the warmth of my family. All I see is darkness and the memories of them are the only things I think of. I can’t even explain what it’s like being in this nightmare. This is my life, for the rest of my shitty, useless, worthless, no good life I’ll endure this nightmare and I deserve it.

Without going into too much detail, my last boss was horrible to me. She went against district protocol to do whatever she wanted. She blamed me for things that had absolutely nothing to do with me and gaslighted me into believing it was my fault. I actually found out that this involved another person but she lied to blame it on me. She also micromanaged me to the point where I was having panic attacks. I resigned from that job and this happened two years ago but I still feel hurt by it. This woman’s treatment of me haunts me sometimes and I cannot fathom how someone could have such little regard for another person. She triggered my depression. I went from a woman who hardly ever cried to crying at the drop of a hat and wanting to die. I did recieve therapy and continue to take medication but it still hurts me. My confidence is a level zero and I want it back (what little I had). 

Can anyone else relate? What triggered your depression?",2,2,2
u/thadoctordisco,2,"I don't know what to do... Just having a bit of a crisis tonight. I'm 25, graduated from college 3 years ago, and I don't know what to do with myself. I don't know what I want to do in life. I say that I do, but I really don't, and I'm beating myself over it everyday. In the last 3 years, I've had 2 jobs, got fired from both, and I'm currently working part-time as a substitute teacher. Currently living with my grandmother. Got off a shift from an elementary school today (never again), and it made me consider my life. It made me think about the people I know. I occasionally see my former peers in real life and social media. I'm happy for them and I wish them luck, but, unfortunately (and I hate this about myself) it has an adverse effect on me. only makes me look at myself and want to punch me in the face. Under worse scenarios, it makes me want to die. My entire life, I've been the hardest on myself, probably as an unhealthy mechanism to keep me down to earth.

Right now, the only thing I know how to do is write. Books, scripts, things like that. It's the only thing I know. It's the only thing I want do to. I always tell my therapist that I have a set goal in mind: to become a renowned writer, but I'm starting to realize that I've been lying to myself. The more I say it, the more I feel I'm trying to convince myself that I know what I'm doing. The truth is, I don't, and I hate myself for it. I don't even think I'm particularly good at it. I don't even know what I want to write.

It's one of those thoughts that you unconsciously lock away to keep from thinking about it and feeling bad over it, but every now and then, something triggers that thought and you just feel down for however long. I remember, in a passing moment in therapy, she brought up the idea of a life coach. I've never really considered that but I don't even know if it's a good idea to put all this weight and nonsense on another person. Would that even be a good idea?

But, obviously I’m still here because I decided to not pull the trigger on myself—not once, not twice, but multiple times. Sometimes I wonder why I didn’t do it, but I let it go. I made the decision not to, and (as I’m remarkably stubborn) I’m going to live with it. But... I understand the feeling of utter and complete loneliness that is associated with the suicidal ideation, and this isn’t it. It’s not the same, or, not quite the same. It’s almost more intense, sometimes. I constantly feel like every accomplishment, every success, is false. I feel like every relationship is fake, that everyone in my life is only there due to pressure, or pity, or because they’re my family. You know? And the one person that I want to talk to, the one person I truly feel like I can share this with, is the girl—one of my best friends—that I am crushing on... and the girl that rejected me, but still insists upon talking to me and coming back to me for advice. The girl that will still end up coming to me for support when her boyfriend dumps her, or the girl that I will never get the luck to have because every guy she finds proves to be better than I am.

Then the following day they came back to bully me as usual. I had some friends so not everything was bad, but I was suffering a lot and one year after the accident I tried to kill myself at the age of 13. Both times I ended up in the hospital I had my birthday there. From that moment I've been always going in and out of a depressive state, always had low self-esteem and when I started fucking things up, doing bad things to innocent people I also started hating myself, in the last years I was doing pretty well, I had made some new friends I would see almost every weekend, but then again I messed up, I betrayed their trust, I was a bad friend to them and now I feel the worst.
I think there's nothing I can do to fix things now I just hope they get over me, forget I exist, I know I'm a little vague with what I'm sharing here but I used to think my friends were the most important thing in my life, and I couldn't even take care of that.

u/metzona,4,"It's pointless My experience with doctors, medication, and therapy have all been negative since I started trying to get help.

Every time I see my doctor, I end up waiting an hour. When I finally see him and try to explain what's going on, he cuts me off and says that he only has five minutes. All he needs to know is if I need a new prescription. I tell him that the medication isn't working, that it's making me too drowsy and I'm feeling worse. He just tells me to take more before leaving the room. I'm not his target demographic, and it shows. He only cares about seniors, babies, and women who want children/are pregnant. There are times where I think he's getting paid by companies to promote certain medications. He always tries to push the newest brand name products on me that cost hundreds of dollars.

Every medication that I've tried doesn't work. It doesn't change anything for the better. They just make me drowsy to the point that I'm a zombie and even more mentally fragile because I'm even more tired 24/7. I get withdrawal symptoms every time. More headaches. More irritability. More exhaustion and despair.

Every therapist that I've been to has made me feel like I should just end it and save everyone time. The drop-in therapists that I've seen all told me that I don't have real problems. They told me that wishing people cared about me is selfish, and that they all have bigger problems to worry about rather than me whining about non-issues. The multi-session therapists I've seen just tell me to be grateful for what I have, which just translates into me being ungrateful. They tell me that I should meditate and go for walks. Yeah, because I can *totally* meditate in a home environment where I have no privacy, and where trying to have some peace and quiet by myself is impossible. And sure, I can *totally* go for a walk when I feel anxious from just being in a public space, and I can *definitely* exercise when I have zero energy at the start of the day.

It's all pointless. It doesn't help. I just feel worse. All of this just proves that I don't deserve to be happy, and that I need to just shut up and accept my place in life. I'm never going to be loved. I'm never going to be cared about. I'm just someone to fill space until someone better comes along. I'm just someone for people to take their anger out on.

u/mochipill,1,"No matter how much time passes it never gets better. Hi im a 17f and i feel like shit. For the past 7 years, my life has gone downhill and seems to be staying that way. My mom became serious ill when i was 10 leaving me with a lot of responsibility. I have younger siblings and i take care of them all including my mom. My dad works full-time so i always want to take the load off of him by cleaning and cooking. But cleaning and cooking all the time has made my home life insufferable and unfortunately my social life was too good either.

I moved my senior year of high school and lost almost all my friends except 2. Due to this, i spun into a deep depression becasue the people at my new school didnt care that i even existed and loosing almost everyone else took a toll on me. I did talk to one of my old friends but the other one never really talked to me so i never really reached out to them (ik its my fault but i was honestly struggling and my other friend would have been ignored too if they didnt always text me).

On top of my depressive episode, my mothers condition worsen and she had several scary seizures that made me extremely anxious all the time. But after things calmed down i went to talk to my friend that i haven't spoken to since i moved and they proceeded to tell me to not talk to them anymore and that we were too toxic for each other. I didn't know what i did wrong and this sent me back to my dark place. 

After a while, i decided to tell myself college would be better and i even got into my dream school (which i had to reject becasue of finaces and my parents not wanting me to leave home since i do so much, had to stay local). I tried to be postive like everyone says but it was just one thing after another and i felt myself breaking down.

I started college an honestly it was awful. I felt like since im not the prettiest girl or skinniest girl (i gained a lot of weight), no one wanted to talk to me. I did try though and one of the people i was talking to told me she didn't want to trade Instagram's after i asked (btw we spent like all of orientation together and talking so i honestly thought it was an appropriate time).

 I started realizing that my depression weight gain has caused my already fucked up social life to crumble. Im not sure if im weird or just too ugly to look at but no matter how hard i try, making friends seem to be impossible for me. Even if i do make friends, im never myself around them. I always have to mask and be the ideal friend to them and its really tiring but if i dont do it, 100% of the time, i loose my friend. 

I would love to do clubs and events but again im very much needed at home becasue of my mom's condition and i honestly feel like giving up. Im not in the major i want to be (my parents forced me to do STEM), i hate the way i look, i hate having to take care of my siblings (even though i adore them), and i hate my life.

its gotten to the point where im not even sad. im just empty. I kept pushing just for all of this to mean nothing. One of my old friends from years ago told me that i was probably the unluckiest person ever and honestly its true. Cause how many fucked moments do i need to get through until it gets better like everyone says? how much longer until i can wake up in the morning and not feel sick to stomach, how much longer until my life gets un fucked?

There is a darkness inside. It is insidious.

It is not a force of power. It does not attack with strength. It holds no passion. It is a slithering slow poison which takes the color from the sky and steals the light from my eyes. It tries to convince me that the blessings in my life are not good enough. It casts a shadow on my heart and tells me that the things that bring me joy make me unhappy because they are not good enough. It whispers that there will be a better life waiting for me if only I cast away everything I cherish in my heart.

There is a darkness inside. It has been with me all my life.

There is not a single reason why. No easy to point to answer. No tale of trauma or things gone wrong. The darkness comes from not quite fitting in. Life is a shaped hole where a peg must go through. I am an almost square peg needing to fit an exactly square hole. The peg fits eventually, but a little splinter fights, like the remainder of a long tail division that inconveniently doesn’t equate to zero. This remainder forms the darkness.

There is a darkness inside. It lies, waiting. It is trapped.

It is in a cave, covered with a heavy manhole cover. When I forget about it, it is powerless. It withers away. But at the same time, when it sleeps, it grows more dangerous. Because I forget. And I stop holding the cover down and something happens in life to rattle the darkness, it finds the door open. And like black ooze it slithers out, ready to poison my thoughts like Grima  Wormtongue whispering in the ear of King Theoden.

There is a darkness inside. It cannot hide from me, any more than I from it.

I recognize it. The darkness is cunning yet for all that, its effects are easy to identify. When life starts to lose its color, I understand the color is not gone because I have faith. When the light goes from my eyes, I know the light is not gone. When the poison affects me, I am like a grown man watching a puppet play. The puppets move, but I see the strings that make them dance. I cannot hide from the darkness, but neither can it from me. 

There is a darkness inside. I do not despair.

I understand it, it does not frighten me. When the darkness comes, I do not hide from it. I do not deny it. When the color dies, I do not cower. I do not try to keep the darkness away because I know the light is still there even if I cannot see it. I say to the darkness IS THIS ALL YOU GOT!? DO YOUR WORST!!!! I call it to me. I bind it to me. I tell it to try harder. As it solidifies, I can grab it as it grabs me. It cannot flee me or hide. And so, I ram it back in its hole and slam the door shut.

There is a darkness inside. It is part of me.

I know the darkness. It is part of me forever. I do not hate the it or resent it. I do not try to destroy it. It comes from being a peg that does not quite fit. It is not the fault of the little parts that do not fit. The peg didn't choose to be this shape. It didn't choose what hole it had to fit. The only way to destroy the darkness would be destroy me. Through the happenstance of birth and the shape of life, The darkness  and I are like 2 sides of a coin, bound together forever.

There is a darkness inside…",2,2,2

I don't want to say exactly what it is, in case someone sees this.

There's no one I can talk to, because campus is closed.

There's nothing I can do.

I hate the work, I hate the people, I hate the culture, I hate that I've wasted three years of my life.

In the end, my biggest assessment is collaborative, and no one wants to work with me because my concept was ""too difficult"", so I'm virtually guaranteed to fail.

There's no light at the end of the tunnel, either I fail now, or I fail later. The difference is how many people I'll piss off if I fail now.

There are deadlines coming up, and I'm not going to meet any of them.

It's getting to the point where I don't care how unprofessional that is, I don't care how many people it's going to put out, I can feel my stomach drop whenever I even think about the degree.

If I drop out, I'll make at least 30 people hate me just like that.

It's gotten far beyond a childish ""DON'T WANNA DEW IT"", it's just absolute fucking fear. I hate it. I hate it so much.

It just feels so wrong to even try and do it.

I almost dropped out last year, but it feels like literally everyone just swooped in to convince me to not give up. You can't give up. You just can't give up. Never give up. Don't ever give up.

We won't let you.

And if you do, then you're pathetic :)

I've been looking up ""signs I should quit my job"", and I don't think any of them have ""dread on a pure, existential level whenever you think about something work-related"" on the list.

And the one class I actually do like? The workload from the others gave me no time for anything else, so I'll fail that one too.

I feel like I'm backed into a corner, and the only ways out are a beating, or another, slightly worse beating.

It's okay, you can laugh.

I'll probably never study in that town again.

My parents would probably kick me out because ""gee wiz, you fucked up an actual UNIVERSITY degree this time? WOW! YOU CAN COME BACK WHEN YOU ACTUALLY DO SOMETHING WITH YOUR LIFE!"".

I will make no lifelong friends, no connections, no relationships, no degree, nothing on my CV, no new and exciting job opportunities, no approval from anyone, no graduation party/dinner/whatever.

Nothing.

Broke up with my girlfriend, dating was fun but so time-consuming, but I needed someone to hold me up because I felt so alone I couldn't function. So don't say ""try finding someone."" I don't think anyone deserves to be used by my selfish need of not feeling alone. I do feel really bad because I latch onto people, so I feel like if they need me, then I feel like I have a reason to stay alive. 

 School is so shit too right now, too. Debt, and I barely passed my last semester. I know if I start again, I definitely fail, this one, because I don't have enough energy to even get up most mornings. I make 15 dollars an hour at my job, but I'm already 1k in debt imagine adding more semesters on, I'll be in debt for years and years even if I do get a higher paying job. 

Below average on the looks scale. Parents hate me and used to abuse me a lot in my childhood. I can't stop taking drugs because it's the only thing I look forward to right now. I can't drive and I probably won't be able to for a long time because I can't even get out in the mornings sober, and the only thing moving me out of bed to go somewhere is ""you can get high if you go outside today"". I can't function sober anymore, even if it mostly just weed. Spending amounts like 60 to 400 dollars a month on drugs. 

Raging eating disorder. I binge food and then restrict it. I can't even stand myself in photos because it makes me want to puke seeing how disgusting I am. My body already feels and acts like it's 80 years old because of how much damage I've done to it. Even if I don't heal from my disorder, I'll have to deal with the effects forever. 

If this is just the start of my adulthood, I don't want to live anymore, I can't. This is a living hell. Probably by the end of the year, I'll definitely end it.

u/ShirleyMoor,3,"Worst year so far I've been fighting with depression for like 10 years now. Sometimes it's bad, sometimes it's worse. Occasionally i did find something to keep me distracted, but for all these years depression kept looming over my shoulder, falling on me with ever growing weight each time i got to bed at night. I couldn't fall asleep for hours, many times staying up until the sunrise, so i tried to get myself as tired as i can to basically drop dead when i got to bed, and that worked for some time. It always felt like I'm trying to run away from ever growing shadow, that was moving faster with each day
2019 was tough. I had basically no money, only so much that i could pay the bills for the month. I got out of abusive relationship that kept me very stressed for 3 years and somehow i was upset about it. A little dev project that i had failed and i got out of things that kept me distracted, while relatives kept telling me that I'm worthless and talentless.
But then 2020 came and things changed. Even with all the bad things happening in the world i was considering myself finally happy. It felt like my struggle finally payed off, I had reasons to live, I wanted to live and i thought that i finally conquered depression. It was the best felling in the world at the moment - knowing that something that haunted you for a decade is no more.
And then things went sideways. I screwed up, life screwed me up, and everything that could go wrong did, in especially nasty way. So here i am now, with empty hands, lost the only thing that kept will to live in me and the worst is that the depression is here again, stronger than ever.
It's like being released from a solitary confinement to see how beautiful is the world outside only to get shoved back again now having what to mourn, sitting there scared and alone

People keep saying to me that i should start doing something and it will get better but i just can't anymore. Even getting up from the bed is a challenge because i just have no reason to do it anymore. I have nothing and noone to distract myself from the cold darkness

I’m extremely attractive; I’m intelligent; I’m a hard worker. However, I just can’t not hate myself. I feel like a let down, one giant loser. I was never super athletic, or good at sports. Our football team in high school only won two games out of 36. I graduated with 3.91 GPA from a tiny high school and got admitted to the largest public university in the state. I dropped out a month later so that I didn’t lose the tuition money. I started going to community college. I lost my 2.5 year relationship six months after. I got into another relationship and lost that one five months later. I got a job in healthcare so that I had experience prior to nursing school: I quit that job five months later and went back to my old job when they welcomed me with open arms. I entered a new relationship and lost that one two months later. I went to nursing school; I dropped that after two days so I didn’t lose tuition money out of fear that it would be like the job I hated. I got my old job back (again).

I hate when she gives other people attention, or I’m at least relatively uncomfortable with it. She doesn’t give anyone attention that is inappropriate by any means. She’s very firm with respecting our relationship boundaries, yet I always feel as though she’s secretly criticizing me and dislikes me. I have a poor relationship with my family.

u/mara2525,1,"Need a little support I’ve had depression since middle school, genetically predisposed and had a untreated schizophrenic abusive homicidal mother.  She beat me daily and tried to kill me numerous times. My whole life heard the promises of adults that things would get better when I got older instead of actually getting me any help... Anyway, I did what they said: finished high school, then college, while working 3 jobs and trying to “give back” by volunteering... My degree was in biology. It took me 15 months to find a job in my field. I got a position as a chemist at a pharmaceutical company. Things were okay-ish for maybe a year and a half, until the company I worked for sold our site to another company. Then the 18 hour days started, plus weekend hours and we were “salary” so we weren’t compensated for the overtime. I didn’t have time for therapy anymore or visits to my prescriber. The depression spiraled. Then my boss started, from my view, threatening me. Saying things like, “you’re coming to work without a smile, you should be happy to work here, we can replace you” and despite my greatest efforts “you need to step it up or we’re going to fire you.” All of which culminated in my first suicide attempt and my first hospitalization. There were 3 years of this cycle: too much stress at work, depression spiraling, hospitalizations, 7 of them. Inpatient, outpatient, aftercare... I couldn’t take it anymore and under the advice of my family with the assurance they would take care of me financially, I quit. My blood family did not actually end up taking care of me but my fiancé and his family did. I’ve been wanting to start over career-wise. I can’t go back to pharmaceuticals. After a year, I finally got a full time position at a bakery. I was so excited! I LOVE baking. It’s something I used to help keep me sane since childhood. My soon to be MIL asked me about applying for jobs. So I told her, with much enthusiasm, “I got a job as a baker! I start Tuesday!” To which she responded “Oh, I guess you can do that until you get a real job.”
That crushed me. I’m starting tomorrow. I was, I should be, so excited. I just keep replaying what she said over and over in my mind. It stings every time. I’m sorry it’s a long post, but I was just hoping to get some support. Thanks. &lt;3",1,1,2

u/GarbageJane,3,"Helping someone with depression Maybe this is the wrong group to post this, if so, disregard.

My husband struggles with depression. I, fortunately, do not. It’s always been something that I feel makes it really hard to fully understand him. I really do try to help, but I feel like it’s not enough and I’m at a loss. 

He’s tried 3 different therapists and with each fail he has a hard time searching for a new one. When he tries to talk to me about it, I try to be understanding but the conversation always ends up with me saying something like “Babe, idk how to help you. I think you need to try therapy again”. Then from that he always says “you never know what to do and always recommend a therapist”. I’ve tried explaining to him that my reasoning is I’m not trained in this and I sometimes think if I say the wrong thing then it can make it worse. I also have never experienced what he goes through and as much as I truly try to understand, I know I can’t. 

He’s an extremely negative person and I’m not. I look for the positive in almost everything and I feel like that sometimes just sets him off. I know his negativity impacts me, but I also know I can handle it. 

What’s hard is trying to make him smile daily and failing. It’s hard seeing him never happy. I want to help and I don’t know if I’m even capable.

Any advice on ways to be supportive without making things worse is appreciated.",1,1,1
u/Maleficent-Doctor-10,2,"Don’t know what to live for anymore As the title suggests, I (m25) had the sudden realization a day or two ago, that I don’t really know what I live for anymore. I have a diagnosed depression, but I’m in a healthy relationship with the most beautiful and perfect woman, got a little golden retriever puppy I absolutely love, have a lot of great friends, university is going great and I can’t complain about my financial stability. But I just came to the realization that I don’t know what keeps me going anymore. I lost interest in almost anything I’ve ever loved. Gaming, reading, sports, playing guitar. Spent my whole life with most of it. Especially gaming was a savior the last decade or so. But I’m not feeling it anymore. I just realized that I basically keep myself alive to spend time with my dog and my girlfriend. But as soon as I’m not with my girlfriend because one of us has other plans I’m feeling as if my life just stopped. I guess to a certain degree that’s normal, but I figured I should live for something else too. I should live for myself as well. But I don’t. Don’t even know how to put this feeling into proper words. I do have dreams and goals I want to achieve down the road. But I feel no motivation at all anymore. Don’t know what to do. I don’t want to end my life, but I also don’t know why I’m still here in the first place. Maybe someone knows what I’m talking about and has some advice. Sorry for this nonsense.",1,1,1

u/-yoko-,2,"“Friends” I always have to put on a fake happy mask when I’m chatting with some friends. There’s only a handful of 3 people I can have a genuine conversation with without them telling me “It’s okay, it’ll get better,” then getting ghosted for the next several days. I feel selfish that I feel compelled that they should be there to support me but being very dismissive when I’m obviously down and I’m there to help whenever just makes me feel even worse. The 3 people that actually have genuine conversations with me would talk to me for hours on end whenever one of the three is available and it feels so great, even when they’re short and concise and relatable it feels amazing — but my other friends are just so demeaning when I’m sad and I get ghosted for a while. I can’t even have a normal conversation with a friend I’ve connected with so much because of our Narcissistic parents because they’ve developed edge lord humor and intentionally makes typos and satire emojis whenever I ask for help.

u/lrvuitton,1,"18F. I feel like I am about to do something bad English isn’t my first language, sorry for mistakes. 

I have been depressed since I was 12. I had a bad childhood, I grew up with my mom also being so depressed but I didn’t understand it then. My dad is not in my life. My mom always hid her feelings and taught me to do it as well. 

I am not going into much detail but today she couldn’t hide her suicidal thoughts anymore and it broke my heart to see her talk like that. She said she wants to disappear but I am the only reason she doesn’t do it. Our problems have been mainly about money. She wants to leave our town but there is no way she could do that on her own with no money to support her. Now this will take a wild turn I know, but I am planning to sell my virginity to an old sick minded man. I have zero goals in life and I don’t have any respect for myself. I am not going to study my ass off for a job as I don’t have a strong mind for that. I am just worthless. I am 18 so this is legal, I am planning on giving the money to my mom and then commit suicide when she leaves the town. I just don’t know how to start all that",1,1,1

I live in the UK, and so far the doctors I've seen (not regarding my mental health) would rather throw some pills at you than actually deal with the damn issue. Would I like to speak to someone? Probably, but I'd probably be waiting 6 bloody months, and even then it might not work.
