u/Usual-Advantage4120,2,"Long withdrawal afer antidepressants? Hey everyone,  
I (29m) successfully tapered Effexor from 75 to 0 and am at 0 for the past 4 months.  
I took effexor (and other AD's) at different dosages for the past 10 years.

  
My anxiety hasn't come back and every physical withdrawal symptom has subsided, which I am very grateful for.

  
However, I still get random spikes in my emotions (mostly cry for no reason or when I see something sad or just randomly. I couldn't cry when I took effexor). Sometimes I feel down, but I notice I am analysing my feelings more now that I'm off the meds. It's not like they made me 'happy' for any reason.

  
Could this still be my brain adapting or am I going to just have to learn to live with this and try to control it?

  
I work out, eat healthy, try to do everything I can for my mental health. I am struggling with some physical health issues, which don't help my mental state.

  
Is there such a thing as a longer withdrawal, seeing as I took AD's for about 10 years on and off?

  
Thanks in advance, any help or advice is appreciated.",1,2,1
u/SgbAfterDark,1,"Despite my best efforts I can’t build a good social network TL:DR: I just want to feel close to someone, but everyone is being so cold, distant and even aggressive in my life rn

Nothing too bad is happening, I’ve experienced much worse and I’m sure this is nothing compared to most ppl, but I just feel like no one wants to be close friends with me, I just have a bunch of surface level friends, surface level friends I can’t even hang out with and my guitarist from my band is being a dick to me, I’ve made mistakes, but I don’t think they warrant how I’ve been treated.

The past year I worked in a high stress field as a care provider. I think I could’ve lasted longer, but I had long grueling days, but no one to hang out with for any kind of distraction. I talked to my best friend and he said “well we have a lot of friends around here, they all like you, you’ve just been busy”. So I decided to quit work so I can build up my social circle so I can have ppl to have fun with while I go to grad school.

I hit my friends up like once a week and they’re always busy, they do camping trips they said they’d take me on, they go to parties they said I was invited to at first. I met a new friend in that social circle and she really liked me at first, then she kinda ghosted me. She told my best friend she didn’t feel comfortable around me, my best friend was concerned and said “was he creepy? Did he hit on you or something?”, she said “no, he didn’t do anything wrong, just vibes”. 

Now my best friend still texts me, but we haven’t hung out in weeks, which is very weird for us. He normally asks to hang at least once a week. He said he’d try to take off work to see my show, even tho I didn’t ask, so maybe on some level he still cares, but I have a hunch he still hangs with our other friends. I have no idea why he’s dodging me, maybe he’s going thru some stuff, but he normally wants to talk about it

My band is about to play a big show for us (not big in general, just our first official show) and like anything with music, dealing with booking and the organizing is a wreck and I feel like my guitarists punching bag thru all this. Whenever things go slightly awry it’s my fault, he didn’t like the pay for it and blamed me for not knowing that ahead of time, but he said before “I don’t care how much we get paid as long as we can play”, also he could’ve asked too. Our seshs have been really tense when they really don’t need to be

I have been reconnecting with an old friend from highschool which is nice. Unfortunately I’m a bit attracted to her, she texts me a lot and is very platonically affectionate, but I don’t wanna show any attraction cuz I don’t wanna ruin the friendship. She double/triple texts me when I don’t respond, but if I double text her I feel she doesn’t respond well, feels like a double standard. She talks about being lonely and having no one, but she’s still busy with friends and dates, idk what’s wrong with me

It’s Friday night and everyone’s busy, I’m at home. I can’t even get ahead on schoolwork because my school accounts aren’t fucking working, fuck man",1,2,1

So, this is my third week being a barista at a boba shop, minimum wage with no tips. 

Yes, I understand getting paid low isn’t a reason to do bad. 

But at first, no proper training was provided. They just threw me out there and expect I will just look at the recipes or ask other colleagues when have questions.
But this method doesn’t work when it gets really busy. I felt that I am annoying everyone when I constantly ask question when they are busy. 
I really tried to learn. But I just couldn’t be familiar with all the drinks like my coworkers. 

My boss is pretty rude and has poor communication skill. Instructions are so unclear. 70% of the time I cannot understand what he is saying. One time, I put wrong thing in the drink, and I asked what should I do. He mumbles I thought he said just toss that. Then he said, “thats money! I said just keep it like that why you threw that” and makes me feel so dumb at that moment. 

He is so unsatisfied with my performances. Constantly pointing out how bad I did. When I was washing utensils, he is like taping on my shoulders “oh can you just do faster”. 

When I am just sorta taking a break and chit chat with my coworkers, he’s like taping my shoulder again “hey did you clean up that trash?”. 

Honestly I hate people touching me. Being my boss doesn’t grant him rights to touch me without consent, right? But at that moment, I really don’t have the energy to fight back for myself.

u/diegonieva,1,"Depression killing my marriage Hi all, 43M

I am not entirely sure why I am writing this.
I have been struggling with depression for about five years now. It all started with some little symptoms and grew into needing medication, a major depression disorder diagnosis and a lot of work to not sink even further

I stopped therapy after a few months because I felt that was doing well with the medication. I failed to see that what was happening around me was that everybody was having fun in their lives except for me. For example, we would go on holidays with a group of friends and I'll be the last one to wake up. I would be the one who would stay in the house or the hotel and napping, while others were doing activities and having fun and that extrapolates to pretty much every activity in my life like conferences for work, activities with my kids, I stopped taking them to sports and things like that.

In parallel, I leaned on my partner (41F) to dig myself out from depressive thoughts, intrusive thoughts, suicidal ideation, and very very low and dark mood swings.

Fast forward to this year, and she told me today, that after so many years of struggling with this, she cannot take it anymore that I have been hurting her with my spiralling, that she feels like she's living with two different people, that at some point, I let my frustration lash out onto her. This, unfortunately, is absolutely true. I have tried to control my emotions as best as I could, and even on 200 mg of Zoloft or sertraline, I still feel like I cannot control it.

The catalyst of all of this was that she had planned a trip to have fun with some friends, and I let my insecurities to get the best of me, and she had to come back after 24 hours of being there because I kept texting her relationship doubts, insecurities and mean thoughts.

Upon arriving back to our home, she told me that she can't continue doing this, and that she thinks that we should take some time apart, we have been married for 17 years, and because I am the one who finds it hard to control emotions we decided that it was best for me to leave the house. We also agreed that this was the best first our children as she can control ber emotions and I would be a ball of cry in the couch all weekend. 

We also agreed that this is not an ending, embracing the grey area of “taking time apart to rethink who we are, what we want and how to fix this”; however, we are both very sure that we don’t want to end it. Not yet at least. 


The result of all of this is that now is 11 pm, and I am in a hotel room alone; missing my wife, missing my kids, struggling to find reasons to stay alive, although I know that I wouldn't do that mainly because of the harm and damage it would cause on people who love me including her and my kids.

I am torn between the feelings of wanting to improve and as she put it “ go back to my usual self because she doesn't recognise who I am today."" and the feeling of “what is the point in continuing to fight. If I know that the results are temporary and then I'll be back to being this boring, apathetic, horrible blob of nothingness.”

I know that usually it feels dark when you are in this state and I know that at some point, things will get some clarity and I will come out on the other side with a lot less pain in my heart. Right now, though, it feels like my whole world is ending. I have no control over what's happening and I have no control over the things that are most important for me.

I love her so so so much that the pain I feel right now can only be compared to what I imagine a 1000 tones rock sitting on my chest would feel like.
I am gonna try to sleep now, but I know how painful will be waking up tomorrow and not having our usual morning routine of the weekends.

I am in a lot of pain, I am disappointed in myself, and I feel like my life is slipping away through my fingers.

If you're still reading this and you are having doubts about leaning too much on your partner for support I beg of you: find other people to lean onto because the mental health toll that this has taken on my wife is not only visible, but has created this massive drift between us that I don’t know how to fix anymore. 

I feel so very alone right now. 

Thank you for reading.

I have begun medications and they have thoroughly helped me become more productive and less depressed, however, there is still this echoing and painfully icy hole in my soul that I can't seem to fix.

I have tried to bond with others based on hobbies, and I have tried to meet people online. I have joined clubs and talked to people at work, and yet I still cannot for the life of me make a single friend. I know I'm awkward and I try to make it a more playful and charming trait, because I can't really fix it, but I guess I'm just not that charming.

Most of the time, people just never reach out. No one wants to put any effort into talking to me, so its always up to me to initiate anything, even with the people who do actually enjoy my ideas and words. The attempts I have made online have either led to ghostings or me being a stand-in for a therapist. Everyone else has used me or lied to me or hurt me.

Recently I noticed she’s been making multiple posts with suicidal references. 

“Who wants my dogs after I hang myself?”

“Might just pop a bunch of pills soon” 

“I hate myself”

I sent her some kind messages about our friendship and her good qualities, but she never responded.  I’m not offended because often with depression people have a hard time writing back — but I’m concerned. (Later she did like the messages)

She moved about 10 hours away from our hometown, and I’m a broke college student. I can’t go visit her. Her family was abusive growing up so she has no contact with them.

I know it wouldn’t really come off this way because I try not to share my personal issues with others. I just never really saw the point because I don’t think other people would understand my situation or what I’m going through. I also don’t want to bother people with issues they can’t help me with or do anything about. So I just try to figure it out on my own because I thought ultimately only I understood my problems and only I could fix them. But to be very honest I don’t know if I can do this on my own anymore. I’ve been depressed for years, it has only gotten worse and worse lately. To the point where as I mentioned I’ve been thinking a lot about killing myself. I don’t fantasize about self harm but I do think about just ending it all. As far as what methods I’ve thought about, I have been thinking if I were to do it I’d want to use a gun and just shoot myself in the head. Seems like the easiest way to go out I could think of. No pain… at least as far as I know. It’s also very lethal, not a lot of people survive bullets to the head so it would have a high chance of success. Also I could be discreet about it, meaning no spectacles in front of the public. The only issue is that I have no access to a gun. I also don’t know how to obtain one since I’ve never owned one before. Well I guess there’s also one more issue, the fact that I don’t really want to die fully yet. Also I’m not brave enough to actually kill myself. I guess deep down I know I don’t actually want to die, I just want to live a better life. So as long as I still have hope that I could change things I won’t actually kill myself. The problem is that doesn’t stop the constant suffering I feel EVERY single day. It hurts a lot because it feels like I’m living my life inside my head. I’m incredibly lonely, I don’t have any friends. I’ve never really had any. I’ve never really had a real social life. So I cope by living life inside my head. Things that I want to accomplish, friends I wish I had, conversations I wish I could have with those friends. In my head I picture laughing with imaginary people I’ve made up. I even have an imaginary girlfriend. Typing this up makes me feel like a loser but it’s what keeps me going honestly because of how lonely I am. I feel like it’s taken it’s toll on me mentally.

But my dad is the type of person who doesn't believe depression is real, or maybe he acknowledges it but believes that powering through is the solution, and maybe he's right and I just don't like hearing it from him because he can be a dick. 

But I've been clinically depressed for a little over a year, and it definitely affects my motivation and work ethic. In high school I was a hard working kid. But ever since I've always given up in the face of a challenge or tried to find the shortcut / easy way out. And part of me wonders if I am in the hole I'm in because of laziness and a lack of self-discipline (not getting up when I'm supposed to, not working when I'm supposed to).

Part of me feels guilty and that I'm using depression as an excuse to not do stuff. And I hate being a victim or feeling like one. My dad just says that like if I want to be successful I need to have the self-discipline to do the things I need to do regardless of how I feel. And part of that independence / ""everything is my responsibility"" has been instilled in me from a young age.

I'm not really sure what I'm expecting in the comments, but maybe how you view depression in relation to self-discipline, work ethic, motivation, creating excuses, laziness, procrastination. It's gotta be at least somewhat on me - I can't blame my fuck ups on neurochemical inbalances.",2,2,2

During the past 2 months I struggled tremendously but with help now feel like I turned a major corner. I’m in a better head space but unfortunately, my bad habits during this bout are tough to break. They include:

- poor diet /nutrition 
- no exercise 
- procrastination 
- lack of self care/appearance 
- sleeplessness 
- daily alcohol consumption (one drink but still)

I feel better mentally but am having trouble feeling unstuck from the unhealthy routine I developed during this episode.

I'm at a terrible point in my life right now because i'm so sick and tired of being alone, unwanted, unloved by everyone i try to talk to, women or friends. No single person likes my personality traits of being very open, honest and vulnerable about my emotions and problems. No one cares and no one wants to be open with me about their vulnerabilities,  even though i'm so open to listen and try to help with advice as best as i could.

All i get is constantly being told- ""we don't like you, you're weird, why are you so open all the time, stop being like that, just be fun 24/7"". I'm not enough to anyone. They only want me funny clown mask all the time, not the real parts of me.

All of this ended up in me having severe trust issues, feeling inadequate all the time, feeling like not a single soul will ever accept me. I have no idea how to communicate with people anymore. Even if i do or say something ever so slightly weird or off, i expect myself to be on their block list the next minute. People just seem to want the most perfect version of me at all times and nothing less. I'm afraid to ask or do anything to people, most of the time they hate and abandon me straight away.

I don't really know how to describe my appearance, but i can probably say that i look younger than my age. That's not a good thing for a man whatsoever. I'm short, skinny, look like a middle-high schooler at most. Doing physical exercises for a few years didn't help at all, i can't get any muscle on my body. I hate my body in fact, i hate my face which i can't do anything about. Not a single woman even looks at my general direction. I'm so sick of being invisible to them, never feeling enough, never knowing what in the world am i supposed to do about it.

u/DisasterFew772,2,"I desperately need some perspective Hello everyone, I am 17 and I feel like my mind will burst into a thousand peices. I have been going through something (I really don't know what to think of this) since February I guess. I'm sorry for this long message. First off I am extremely confused with my emotions. I don't know if I have a mental health issue or if this is just something random. I know I am a teenager and can have emotional disturbance due to hormones and this might be a part of that but that just confuses me more. See this is also how I overthink.  
I have literally tried everything, I have confided in my friends - They have consoled me, supported me, and everything but I just can't seem to believe them. I feel so guilty when I share things with them, it just isn't working out. I also feel like I'm making a big issue out of things.  
I've also talked to my parents and family members. I haven't been able to explain them properly or as consistently but I have tried but they dont understand the depth of what it is, how could they, I can't explain it to them or even myself.  
I also went to a therapist once, but she just took 5 minutes and did the two-week mental health assessment and said that I have nothing to worry about. But I feel like I couldn't explain my thoughts and emotions to her properly. I really dont know. This is so hard. I feel sad half of the time and I dont even know why. I can't focus on work but then I wonder if I'm just using this as an excuse for my laziness. I have exams coming up and I'm so scared.  
There's this one friend of mine who helps me a lot but a few days ago I just told him that I needed space cause like I dont know I feel very irritated and icky sought of when I read our past conversations, cause I feel like he's kind of babysitting me or explaining things to a baby and he shouldn't have to do that. I feel so bad for depending on him so much. He doesn't owe me any of this and still, he does it. But coming back to space so after I stopped talking to him I felt like kind of okay or good for 2-3 days. I didn't think about any of this at all. But like since yesterday I've started to feel a bit off again. I don't know how any of this is related. I feel like can't talk to anyone even though I know I can and so many people are here for me. But the thing is most of my friends are struggling themselves and I just can't be so selfish to put my burdens on them too. Sometimes I just wanna give up but I hold on for my family. I can't do that to them.

(See more details at the bottom of this post)

**The Problem**

Everything is hard, really hard, it takes so much effort to do simple things that it feels unreal. I've always had problems with procrascination but it has gone so far out of control that it has somewhat ruined my life (it feels like it), I've lost my business, I Isolate and distance myself from friends and family because I don't want to see anyone, it takes too much effort to be social and when I do find some strength to be social I feel very drained afterwards. I'm not an introverted person.

I don't want to sound arrogant, but I used to love myself and for the most part was very happy with myself. Now It's a struggle not to hate myself, because I know that I can only blame myself for my inactions. It's It feels like I'm stuck In a self sabotaging cycle that spirals downwards, low-point is followed by another lowpoint and it has gone this way for years now. I'm in a hole that keeps getting deeper and deeper yet I have less and less strength to dig myself out. 

I now only know little glimpses of happines, maybe few days in a year yet I used to be very happy. I have cried lifetime of tiers over the past few years because I just don't understand why I can't find energy or motivation to do anything. I'm not contemplating but there are definitely moments when I don't want to exist in a life that I have created for myself due to my inaction.

I still have plans and arguably most of them are quite good, I muster up what is left of my willpower and find some strength in myself to actually do something but it doesn't last long, then it's few months later, then few years later and where did the time go? I feel like a complete failure and I'm completely stuck.

I hope any of this makes sense...

**What I've been doing**

I've visited several mental health specialists and they always prescribe some type of SSRI, but I feel no difference. I'm aware that medications can take weeks and months to be efficient. But I doubt it's serotonin related. 

I'm working out regularly as it is one of the most common suggestions. But I would like to mention that I've been doing so most of my life and even when I had periods of less physical activitity I never felt this bad. 

I'm sleeping relatively well. Nutrition is quite balanced. I even take probiotics. 

I'm taking supplements - Cod liver oil, Vitamin D, Magnesium, B6, etc.
