u/TemGotZeMuns,16,"Cannot stop hurting myself I've been having psychotic breakdowns seeing and hearing shit that isn't there a few months ago I noticed a pattern of loosing all emotions. It's this sinking feeling and then the emotions are gone. I can't do anything but cut myself to get the feelings back. I've hated myself for such a long time I don't think I'm a good person. I suck at being alive and I just want it to end. I'm too much of a failure to go through with it. Three failed attempts already. I don't remember anything, right now I don't even remember how emotions feel. I've lost all feelings for anyone I have a relationship with, including friends and family. They either leave me or I push them away. I'm just numb the only thing I can feel is pain. I just want to be gone.",1,1,1

u/Tarrgonaut,2,"I don't even know anymore For all those who read this I'm a 15 year old boy going into grade 11 and previous to this story I was diagnosed with Depression, Anxiety, and severe suicidal tendencies

For the last year I was in an abusive relationship with a girl, she was incredibly manipulative and we fought almost everyday even with my extensive efforts to stop it with me just apologizing just to end it.

About 3-4 months ago I learned she cheated on me which beat me down so far, I didn't get out of bed, I was extremely numb and thought about suicide everyday at least twice but after two weeks I forgave her cause I felt like she was the only girl I'd ever have. The best part was she guilt tripped me into letting her stay ""friends"" with the guy she cheated on me with. A month later she asked me to do her streaks and I'm the type to understand privacy and always told her that I value privacy after a traumatic experience when I was 10. But I digress, and I did her streaks and I accidentally clicked on the top guy and went into their chat ACCIDENTALLY.. I see her nudes sent to this guy and saying she'd date him etc. I was furious but after hours and hours of arguing I was burnt out and ready to end it all. She said he stole her phone and sent those to himself and those texts of dating him was from her friend who took her phone. I believed her and I apologized for getting angry and I don't remember her apologizing for that either.

Now by this time it was coming up to be our six month anniversary and I wanted to do something special so I did some research, she came from Mexico and she loved the day of the dead, so I thought I would I would grow her a pot of marigolds a flower known for the day of the dead and daises because it was one of her favorite flowers. By this time I've growing these flowers for easily 2-3 months and they were doing great, I felt this was a lot of effort and a great gift. I told her the gift early because I was to excited to keep it a secret and wanted to tell her, I did and one of the most painful things I heard this day, she said ""that's it?"".. ""could you get me something more?"".. I was furious, I lashed out and I was tired of being second place to her, I was so god damn mad after all the work and effort to keep these flowers alive (which wasn't easy). I broke up with her on the spot over the phone. My family really disliked this girl, they all saw how manipulative and cruel at times she was. I felt free at the time.

I was happy as my family said this was the right decision and I was starting to see the mind games more clearly. A month later she got her friend to tell me to give her things back and by this time I thought I was over her. Her friend said ""you don't have to worry she has a new boyfriend"". I have no idea why but this hurt so badly and I was extremely sad, I got chills for hours. Anyways I texted her, I was shaking violently, I was scared and extremely anxious and I was sweating, I have no idea why I was feeling this way but we got it sorted and I told her I have to go and I can't keep her added for my own safety.

Now as the time of writing I'm extremely suicidal and depressed, I can't get out bed, I can't move. I feel completely alone and I feel everything bad I caused and I had it coming. I'm ready to leave this planet, I want it all to end. I would tell my family and friends but I don't want them to worry and freak out and rush me to the hospital. I feel useless and worthless, I just want to go painlessly and calmly. I don't what I'm feeling is real but it's gotten to the point of every time I pass or see anything dangerous it's almost like my brain logs it and thinks ""Could this kill me quickly?"". I feel crazy and I feel everyone is always mad at me. I just want my life to end so badly...",1,1,1

u/CeresLovesPluto,2,"I miss all my patients so much and keep wanting to join them in the afterlife. I have worked at my nursing home for 3 years. I know my residents well. My entire life is a disaster, from how I look (fat), my health (chronic pain) my love and sex life (dead bedroom) and social life (no family, no friends.) Literally the only good in my life is my job, and I absolutely adore all of my patients even the aggressive ones with dementia.

Covid has made my job into a living hell. Approaching a hundred positive cases, over a dozen deaths in just over a month. I am of course used to losing patients, but not like this...not so fast and not so many back to back. The majority of the deaths are older patients (85+) but some of them are in their 50s and 60s and were completely functional just two months ago. Today my favorite patient went on hospice...I held her hand and talked to her, even though she couldn't hear me because she was unconscious from all the morphine. She will be dead by the end of the week. She won't even get a proper funeral.

I keep waking up in the middle of the night not being able to breathe and I panic that this is it, I finally have covid myself and I'm going to into respiratory distress... but then I just realize its me panicking. Yesterday I had a dream and a bunch of dead patients of mine were welcoming me to heaven, and they were all standing up, looking younger and healthier... I just can't stand it. It physically hurts to think about. I don't know how to keep going and how to be strong. How? How do I keep going?",1,1,1
u/_anonymous_acc,1,"I don't think so I can live anymore. My life is this earthquake prone area. I have been feeling slight tremors since childhood. With each passing year, the intensity of the tremors just grew. And this year, the earthquake hit destroying me and my home. Now I am stuck under rubble and slowly losing out all my energy or will to fight. Breathing is getting harder day by day. I just wish to end it all. 

I had a home in this shaky area in the form of an amazing friendship. It was extremely close and intimate relation, the kind you experience only once in life. But I ruined it because of my insecurities, fears and everything. I shattered the only person who always stood by me no matter what. I betrayed her trust and hurt her a lot. Now she says that we will never be same. We will never go back to who we used to be with each other. We tried working on it but I ruined that progress too because of my mental and emotional instability. She is getting defeated day by day and it's only a matter of time before she also abandons me. I don't want to accept it but my time with her is coming to an end. I can feel that this is the last stage and soon we will become just two strangers who used to know each other's every heartbeat. I will never find someone like her, I have tried. I will never love someone else as much as I loved her. Sometimes I just want to do something so bad that she herself cuts me off from her life. So that she doesn't have to suffer anymore. She is getting tired and so am I but I don't know if I am worthy of her anymore so why make her put in time and energy you know. I don't have anyone else beside her. I broke our home and the guilt and pain eats me up every night. 

People say that everyone lives a bad day but it's just the side they choose. The good side of my day used to be her. No matter how bad my day was, I had our friendship that would balance or sometimes even outweigh the bad in my life. Now I don't have that either so my day is just filled with bad and worse. There is no good here. I tried to find the good but I can't. 

I have been struggling with things for a long time. Practically since I was kid, I used to wish to get into accident and die. I have been doing passive suicidal ideation since so many years. With time, my issues have gotten worse and my trauma has just increased. I am general and romantically lonely. I have never experienced anything in romantic terms and don't know if I will. I am beyond any help. I have no emotional support whatsoever. My depression has gotten worse lately. I rot away in my room. Everyone has told me to work on myself and stuff but that requires me to be alive and feel my emotions. But I am beyond my limit, if I allow myself to feel things I am a huge mess which I can't be. I feel like I will do a huge favour on everyone around me by dying. I am some disease which will slowly eat you away and ruin you. No matter how good I get I will hurt people and ruin everything. My passive suicidal ideation isn't passive anymore. There is nothing to hold on to for me. I just want to end it all.

u/ALaModeAnxiety,8,"I won't open up to my mental health team because of the lethality of my plan I've only attempted on my life once, in May of 2016. I was left with a short-term speech impediment and over 90 days in an inpatient psychiatric facility. I was 22.

Your parents have an idea of what kind of adult they want their child to be when you're born. They want the best for you. They see you graduating school at the top of your class. They see you excelling through college, or in my case the military. They see you finding a good steady relationship and having children. They see you visiting on the holidays with smiles on your faces. 

I want to open up to my family, but it would destroy the imagine that they have of me. I haven't followed the standard conventional plan, but I've done well enough for myself. They have known of the the numerous psychiatric inpatients, but only through phone calls that were masked with humor and light-heartedness    (""heeeyyy, I'm in the hospital. Haha, I'll be out in a few days. No, everything's fine. You know the military, always over careful. Love you, talk to you in a couple days!!).   Even through impatient, I've always presented extremely positive. My family believes that my mental health problems are genetic. The maternal side of my family is drowning in mental illness. My parents have never seen me cry. My parents have only heard me cry once or twice over the phone. I've hardly ever cracked in front of them. 

If I opened up to then, they would have to live with the knowledge of the ""why"" behind my actions. They would have to live with the knowledge that their child was a monster. They would blame themselves. 

However; if I live, they would still be forced to live with the ""why"". All their images of me would be shattered.

I need to know that someone unconditionally loves me, and I'm scared that my parents would prove that to be untrue. 

I present well on the outside. I smile through my therapy sessions, with my suicide risk level at ""intermediate"". I don't open up and they don't know why I keep coming back for treatment is I don't open up and I wear that positive persona. If I crack, I won't be able to put myself back to together. I can never take that ""why"" back, after it comes out. 

I've had a plan for some time. There isn't a time frame behind it, the act will be impulsive because that's the kind of person that I am. I will have a low emotional point, probably something minuscule that I would be able to pull myself out of, but it will be the breaking point. My boyfriend and a few other friends will understand, but many people won't. 

I have a lethal plan. It's easy and simple. It's not involving a firearm, because I don't have the mental fortitude to go through something so traumatizing to whoever finds my body. 

My mental health team will impatient me for a long term stay if I open up my mouth. Maybe worse. 

It definitely won't be today. And definitely won't be this week. Not this month. Maybe a year, maybe next year. But I can *guarantee* that suicide will be my end. My grandmother killed herself in 2016. I've seen it done correctly. I know that I won't live pass 30. It's been too heavy lately. The plan is too lethal. I won't be able to hit the eject button. It'll be like a scary LSD trip. I just have to hold on for the ride.",1,1,1

u/ninjarider1,130,"Almost Succeeded On April 10th, I tried to ""check out"". I suffer from severe PTSD, so I have a lot of anti-depresants and mood stabilizers on hand. I hit a point that it seemed there was just no reason to keep going. I had no romantic involvement for over 6 years, no contact with any of my children or family, and (I thought) no friends. So my assumption was I wouldn't be missed, so ""time to go"".  
I looked online at the overdose effectiveness of what I  had on hand, determined the fatal dose for my height and weight, doubled it, and took them. It wasn't a ""desperate cry for help"". I didn't leave a note. I didn't make any calls. I didn't even tell the person who was staying with me, who wasn't home at the time. I just sat down to watch tv. That's the last thing I remember, until I woke up in the hospital, with doctors telling me to try and breathe, so they could take the tube out of my throat.  
I had been in the hospital for 5 days. The hospital had to track down my son, in South Carolina, to make medical decisions for me, because I had no brain activity for 2 days, and they wanted to disconnect life support. My son refused to allow it. On the 3rd day, I finally displayed activity, and started responding to external stimulus. I still didn't become conscious until the 5th day.  
I was in the hospital a total of 3 weeks. I developed pneumonia, and required IV antibiotics. Then I had to be ""medically cleared"" before they could release me to a psych hospital. I was only there 3 days, but they made sure I was connected to the VA before I was released.   
So, after all that, I am now, re-connected with my son, who I hadn't spoken to in two years. Didn't think we would ever speak again, and now we talk every day. Those ""friends"" I thought I didn't have? While I was on life-support, those ""non-existent"" friends came to my apartment, threw the freeloading ""guest"" out, took my pups to one of their houses, and cleaned my place from top to bottom. Oh, and made sure there was food for me to eat when I got home. And since I got home, my phone has rang, steadily, from people wanting me to know how glad they are I failed in my attempt to depart this vail.  
I'm telling my story so all of you hurting might know that making the attempt is no garuantee of success, and if we do succeed, we never get to see all those who actually do care for and about us. I dodged death despite my best efforts. Now that I'm on the other side of my despair, I'm connected to professionals who are helping keep me stable and communicative. I'm also , finally, being honest with those who I call friends, and who make the time to talk when I ask for it.  
One of the greatest problems I suffered from in my despair was being a mind-reader and a ""seer"" of the future. I always thought I ""knew"" what people were thinking, or what they would do, and it always was negative towards me. The reality is I have no idea what anybody is thinking, or what they may do in any given situation. If I ASK them, though, I am often surprised at how often they are willing to talk, or visit, or even just sit and look at the sun go down. I am lucky I get to see and do all of that today. PLEASE, try doing those things without going through what I did.",2,2,2

u/D1rtymag1c,1,"Dying was the happiest I've felt in years. Hey my name is John im 29! I've battle suicide my entire life even through a young age. I decided not to when I was younger because I was hopeful of the future. I found my future. Got married to a beautiful women, had a beautiful daughter. I spent 10 years with my wife. I make 100-120k for the most recent 5 years. Then 1 day lost everything. I have no house. No car. No job. No money. It's been 1 month since that had happened. I've attempted suicide multiple times. This most recent time was the closet I've came. I heard some more recent bad news and lost my mind. So I grabbed a knife, and slahed my arm open close to 20 times. I didn't feel a thing. I had a few that went through the muscle. Never felt it. While I laid in the floor bleeding out. All I could think about was how it's finally over. I'm finally done. My little brother took his own life 3 years ago, and he jump from a high rise building. I was so happy to have finally committing. Just like he did. I was crying. Not because I was sad. I was happy. Stress free. I was so excited to stop feeling. The feeling got stronger and stronger until I started to get light headed. But damn the luck someone walked into the room I was staying in. Called 911. I was to weak to fight back or I would have. Now I'm here. Back to square 1. Feeling worse than I ever have. No one truly cares about you. Remember that. People want you to live for themselves. They want you to live a miserable life so they don't have to deal with the guilt of you killing yourself. It's just a matter of time before I'm not here anymore.

That he never loved me and that he doesn’t want me in his life (that is, to talk every day for ten minutes, to meet every week etc) and that if I don’t end it, he will end it soon.

They can pursue their interests and hobbies without a voice in their heads telling them to quit, telling them they're weak, they'll never make it because they're shit.

They can plan for the future, they can answer where they envision themselves to be in 5 years, and their answer wouldn't be ""six feet under""

They can interact with others without constantly thinking how they're all plotting against them.

They can actually wake up in the morning looking forward to what the day can bring. Not having the wish to never wake as the first and last thought of the day.

They can be productive, take pride in what they do for society.

They can travel, see the world, create happy memories with the people they love. They can be themselves, not having to be a burden on their loved ones.

They don't need validation for their existence and feelings.

They can take criticism and negative insults without going off the rails.

They love themselves enough not to fall into bad habits or neglect their basic needs.

They can look at other happy people and feel happy for them. Not consumed by jealousy and pain.

They're not in a constant state of agony every waking moment. They don't wish to cry all the time to relieve some of the pain.

I know I did the right thing but I still feel like I betrayed her.  She didn’t want to go to the hospital and begged me not to call 911. she thought that she was fine and her attempt failed - she had taken them the night before and was still coherent and walking around just very sick and all she wanted to do was talk. But now she’s in the hospital I haven’t been able to see her at all since the ambulance took her and because of covid they wouldn’t let me into the Hospital - but I didn’t know that the EMTs made it seem like I could see her once she got there.  I was panicking I’m not sure I even hugged her before she got in the ambulance I thought I was about to see her again.  I know the hospital is the last place she wants to be and even though I know she needs to be there right now and maybe I saved her life I just can’t stop feeling like I betrayed her.

u/RedDStar86,10,"I really want to die. My heart is so completely broken. My sons mother just found out she is pregnant after I pushed and pushed for her to take a pregnancy test because she was a week late for her period. She swore and swore she hadn’t had sex with anyone else but I knew she had been spending time with another guy even though she had still been fucking me. She finally admitted last night that she did fuck this other guy, not even a week after fucking me, and I busted inside her, but apparently so did that other guy. She said she took a plan be emergency contraceptive pill within 48 hours after fucking that other guy but she didn’t take anything after fucking me. Sperm can live inside a girl for 4-7 days. So I’m not sure if this baby is mine or this other guys. and now I am supposed to spend the next 8 months wondering who’s baby it is until a dna test can be done?! She told this guy that she was pregnant but she is leading him to believe that it’s his and left out the fact that she had still been fucking me too. Around the same time. She plans on continuing to see that guy too while hiding that and lying to him too just like she lied about so much shit to me. I can’t wait for this to blow up in her face when that guy finds out that she was fucking me too. Idk who he is, but she can’t hide this from him forever. and I hope he drops her like the hoe that she is when he finds out. I am seriously close to just saying fuck it, and buying a gun when I get paid next Saturday and putting a fucking bullet in my head, and making her watch so she knows just how badly she has emotionally and mentally fucked me up with all of this. I really don’t think I’m going to make it through the holidays. I am really struggling, severely broken, badly depressed, angry af, at her, at God if he exists, at the world, at myself. I really want to die but I just haven’t gotten the nerve to do it yet out of fear of the pain and fear of failing and surviving it. But with a gun it’ll be a lot easier if all I have to do is pull the trigger.

My bones are dripping with a thick layer of melancholy and it's hard to move. My lifeless shell is a cage, seemingly oblivious to the anxiety charging against my skull. Feeling panicked, that familiar but nonetheless uncomfortable weak rush in my limbs, the pounding of my heart in every vein in my body, the indescribable desire to escape; but simultaneously I can feel the air around me that has suddenly become heavy, clinging to me and dragging me down, with a completely numb emotional state.
Where did this fog come from? How can I feel human again?
The episode lasts for days; a blur of both sleepless nights that dragged on in painful hours of tossing and turning, and days where I am barely awake, merely sleeping to escape the feelings. A blur of forcing myself to eat enough,  wondering vaguely where my appetite went and if I could go with it. A blur of dishevelled hair and wearing the same clothes to both sleep and go through the day, and a blur of missed calls and messages from people who weren't going through this storm.

I'm at a point where I'm really alone and don't really have anyone even though I do have people around me, I don't trust them enough to be able to talk about something this deep on this level.  There's probably hundreds of thousands of people just like me that think the same way and know that it of course is not the only answer.  But after so long of the same and having no real way to talk about how I feel safely between any of the people I know it's just worn me down.   I'll explain who I am.

Cars used to be my safe place, I could just go out and let my feelings out fixing things or working on them. I had love with that, knowing I made it and it's working better than normally would from a manufacturer. My car totalled itself and I can't afford it because of university and all these things I had control of emotionally and financially are coming apart completely.  I had to ask my parents for money for gas on this new car I have and I'd never done that before, they just called me all the same things they always have and I'm left feeling worse and in the same position.  I never used to take from anybody, I was strong because I had myself and I could take care of me and I could take care of the people and the things I loved.  

I don't have that anymore and I don't know who I am because of it.  It isn't about financial changes or having to ask for things, this new time in my life has made me realize how truly alone I am and how little those things I care for have cared for me as a person in response (yes I know the car can't love back lol.) It doesn't feel 1:1 anymore and that's one of the scariest concepts I've had to come to grips with.  I'm not here for any attention or anything, I just need someone to tell me I'm not crazy or maybe incapable of love or loving myself or any other of these things that are pushing me down this fucking shit path I've put myself on.  Because at the moment it's a certainty what I'm going to do if I don't change something for myself soon, I have my resolve, no bs or calling some number. I can't.  It's been too many hard nights.  So, if anyone could just shed some light for me, tell me something happy I would love to hear it.

the morning after i decided not to kill myself i woke up to kisses from my puppy. i held his tiny body to mine as i carried him outside and felt the sunlight hit my arms, legs, and face. i smiled at a stranger and they smiled back. i heard birds and i watched the world exist before my eyes.

the morning after i decided not to kill myself i hugged my mother and told her i loved her. i took my antidepressants. to my father’s surprise, i hugged him and my sister too. i texted with my 2 best friends and made plans to see them the next day.

the morning after i decided not to kill myself i listened to music. i filled my body with beautiful sounds. i drew on my legs with markers. i filled my body with art.

the morning after i decided not to kill myself i talked to my grandpa. i asked him how his day was and how he felt. i sat with my family at the dinner table and basked in their presence.

For contest, I'm a trans girl from italy, my family has always been pretty conservative so when they found out I was queer, not because I told them, things just started to go south 


Recently, in a very heated fight, I found out that they were basically always secretly watching me, I used to accessorise myself when I was at school and generally not home to genuinely feel good about how I looked, with jewelery, pigtails, bows and stuff, apparently they had someone taking pics of me at school everyday so they could see me. I don't know who this fucker is and I just wish them the worse tbh


I also found out they paid someone to take away my password to my phone and they found out my chats with my friends where I told them I was worried about my mental health and that I had bpd or something, they obviously criticised me for it, I felt so fucking violated 


I will definitely try to kill myself and make the most people possible that it's their fault, I sent my best friend a suicide note and lots of audios I made that showed how fucked up they are, I asked her to spread all of it in case I died, I know this must hurt her so much but that's just what I want to happen


I know I did bad things but honestly I think I shouldn't deserve to die
I was sexually assaulted by them multiple times, I was basically stalked by them even when I was out of the country, I got beaten up for wearing nail polish, I was punished for something so superficial as clothing, I was the one who was humiliated for self harming, I was the one who saw them destroying a book I bought just because it was about a religion they didn't like, I was the one who was accused of stealing when they were the one who stole all my legal documents and them lied to the cops about it, I was the one who got told that it's right to beat up children and that they actually should have beaten me up more, I was the one who tried to kill herself for all this time, not them.


I know that I'm just giving up but I just don't care, I'm tired, I want them to get what they all deserve, a dead relative, they've always criticised me for everything, for the way I looked, for the way I thought and even for ""not studying"" while I was the one who got the highest score in this fucking excuse of a family to their finals.

Currently, the local sheriff has told me we have to be out by tomorrow (Friday).

...and I haven't told my wife or my daughters.

They're technically homeless and they don't even know it. I basically held out stupid false hopes that I could pull off some miracle or even win the lottery over the past two weeks but nothing.

Plus my dog died on Friday the 13th and I miss him so much.

I've thought about made plans to run away, like the same kind of coward my father was. He left when I was six months old and I've never met him. The fact that I even had that thought has deepened my sense of shame. I tried to subtley hint to my wife that we should just pack up the girls and make off for the west coast but she just thought I was having bouts of wishful thinking.

The only conclusion I can come to is one of ultimate finality. Tomorrow is Friday and sense I've been keeping all of this a secret we have no place to go, no support, and haven't even started to move because they're all oblivious; because of my mistakes and guilt.

All I can think about is how much I'm going to miss growing old with my wife; all the grand plans we had for when we retired. I think about not getting to see my youngest daughter turn 13 in a few months. I worry if the kids at school will pick on her about her dad's mistake.

I live a normal life, struggling like most people. I felt that that equated to failure. I wanted to die instead of having to work until I am 60 and just getting by.

The second was with self-harm. I made a small cut in the wrist area, in the veins, but when I felt the blade poke one of my arteries, I gave up. I got scared.

When I realized that ""real suicidal people"" take absurd amounts of medication and sometimes even mix it with vodka, alcohol or energy drinks, I felt like a genuine fraud. People who are not afraid of death throw themselves headlong into the unexpected. It's like; fuck everything! I don't care about anything else.

And I'm a coward, that's it. Last time should be third suicide attempt, but I don't even consider it a suicide attempt. I tried to kill myself with the absence of food. I didn't even make it past the first day. Didn't work, terrible idea. That was stupid and useless.

The truth is I'm afraid of dying. But what's the point, y'know? Why be afraid of dying when MY existence is just suffering? I mean, sure. I have moments of pleasure.

I don't know whats wrong with me. I should be happy. I have my own apartment, a good job that's covid proof, my own car. All I need to do is not screw it up. Instead I've been on medical leave since before the outbreak, because I simply cannot get my shit together. It's been this way for years.

But I just realized why junkies continue living, because that might legitimately be the only thing left in their lives that brings them any joy.

I have been struggeling with depression and suicidal thought for as long as i can remember.

I still have all the things set in place and means to get it done from my previous attempt.

I used to be a heavy drinker and in the periodes of time where i wasn't drinking i was high all day to take off the edge.

Nothing brings me joy anymore. Any time I allow myself a glimmer of hope, it turns out to be shit.

I recently started seeing a therapist again, and I started a new prescription that's supposed to work well against treatment-resistant depression. It's not working though.

I'm just too broken to be fixed. It's like trying to build a card house in a hurricane. It's like trying to put a broken tempered glass door back together. It's like trying to unspill a dropped jug of milk.

These current attempts to cure myself will be my last. If getting over my depression is reliant on my abilities, then I have no hope. And since prescriptions don't seem to work, I have no hope.

u/MrSaintMichael,8,"All of you reading, have a great night/day I don’t even know where to start or what to talk about. All my life I’ve felt like I could never connect with anyone. Never talk to anyone and nobody seemed to really wanna talk to me. I didn’t know how to socially interact. Never been to a party. Never had a girlfriend. I never even had anyone I was close to. I’ve never been seriously close to anyone in my life until two years ago when I met someone and I finally found that. That spark of connection. They were someone that I’ve never met before... they were everything I could ever want. Pretty, charming, smart and cool as heck. Furthermore, I was someone she felt whole with. She loved me and I loved her, though we swore we wouldn’t be more than friends for reasons I won’t explain due to her privacy. That’s a reason why she liked me so much, she could trust me. I was myself with her and vise versa and she liked that. I was actually funny with her when I wasn’t really with anyone else and she liked that. It wasn’t like she didn’t have a sense of humor, I actually got to be myself and that let out brilliant parts of me and be brilliant for once. 

I was never special to anyone really. Nobody understood me. I wasn’t really attractive to anyone, I was bullied in school. Everyone else had friends and I mean EVERYONE else, except for me. She was the first person I ever truly connected with. I guess someone has to be really special to get close to me. I’m very open minded and I know what I’m saying when I say that I can barely imagine anyone that could be like her with me. 

Again, I’ll keep things vague for our privacy. We were close. Then I got really really self conscious and really really paranoid. You know the feeling when you’re dating someone and you can’t help but get worried that when your significant other talks to someone, they’ll get closer to them and do things with them? Like when they laugh, it’s like “Maybe they’ll get closer with them too” (If I’m the only one that relates to that I really will feel like an idiot lol). 

Yeah I had that. From there, I began unraveling. I started really trying and I stopped being relaxed and just myself. I kept feeling like I was losing my touch after one little time where she didn’t laugh. I kept trying and trying to “be myself again” cause the more I tried, the more I distanced myself from who I really was and the more I kept trying to get back to who I was. It’s like a horrible loop I couldn’t escape. So I got crazy and I started pestering her and being a bother to her and calling her out and writing my heart out and constantly bothering and bothering about how I felt, as if we were spreading apart and just overall being not the person I was but a jealous, psychotic and paranoid shadow of my former self. All until she finally leaves. 

I can’t be myself anymore. I can’t connect to anyone anymore because I’ve strained and forced myself so much I’ve all but lost who I am. Every night I get suicidal. Every night I unravel. I can’t be funny or nice or caring. It all feels fake whenever I talk to someone, like I’m just a shadow. I can’t be the good emotional support I was, I can’t be helpful. I can’t be funny and I’m back to everyone being unable to connect with me. 

I don’t wanna die. I promised her I would stay with her and that includes staying in the realm of the living. It just hurts every day and it feels like it isn’t living almost. I’m just sick of my past torturing me, of being confused and alone. I just want someone again. I want to repair what I’ve done. I know there’s a way... I just really suck at finding it. That and I can’t even do a simple thing at a minimum wage job because I have the worst anxiety. I’m sick of being in pain and torment every day while being empty again all the same.

She betrayed all of it, just like parents did to me first.

It’s my fault for letting that out and trusting her and allowing her to hurt them.

I want to die. I want to fucking die. I feel like someone set me up so they could hurt me as coldly and cruelly as humanly possibly. I want to cut my fucking throat open and die brutally for allowing her near those very sensitive and innocent parts of myself and allowing her to hurt them because I believed her and trusted her.

I just found out that my mom has been cheating, they always fight with my dad, most of the time about money, I dont know clearly what's happening, I think they both have secrets, my dad works overseas for 14 years and my mom is a housewife. I've never seen my dad in personal since 2008 when I was just 6 years old and my little sister, she never seen him personally because he went back to Korea after she was out of the hospital when she was just a baby. She is now 11.

I am suspicious since 2 years ago that my mom might have an affair with this guy that we treat like a real family, he constantly go here every other week and stay here for weeks or a month max.

I've just snooped on her phone while she was sleeping now. I wanted to know the truth so I know what her passcode is and I immediatley goes to the messages and backread her messages, I have noticed that they call each other like they are wife and husband. And then I was shocked when I stumbled to a message saying "" I love you ma *insert dogs with heart eyes emoji*"". After that I return her phone to the bed that she is sleeping and return to my bed.

I am crying, I don't know what to do, my family is completley fucked up right now, I've been brainwash by my mom thinking that she is the victim, but I think infact she is the one who is cheating. I feel like killing myself because I am dealing with major depression, OCD, Social Anxiety, and potentially ADHD and I just hated my whole teenage life, whole my life I've been suffering, I experienced bullying from my ex classmates and my half siblings and I've experienced emotional abuse from my grandma, I survive all of that years of suffering but the scars are left for me to fix, I cant socialize anymore because of my social anxiety, fear of judgement, depression is just unberable, no motivation to do anything, and my family is fucked up, plus it's hard for me to think properly and to concentrate and dont get bored easily.

u/oscarthethrowawayy,28,"A letter to this sub I never used. To anyone who finds themselves reading this,

Hello everybody! I’m here to say goodbye, what a paradox! To make a long story short, I’m not made for this body. This body is not made for me. 
It’s not my appearance or anything. It’s just I wish I never was human at all. To be human means to think, to feel, to be conscious of this world. And I did and was all of those things. I burnt out. 

My mental health is not in pristine shape. In fact, it’s a whole dumpster fire. OCD, panic disorder, generalized anxiety, depression and ADHD. Let me tell you they are not fun neighbors to share a brain with. It’s like a Molotov Cocktail thrown on top of a grease fire. 

I’ve also come to learn in the past few weeks how much trauma I’ve endured. Some of which I can’t even pinpoint. Toxic friends made me forget how to speak. Moving made me never feel at home. I was sitting in class last month and the wind blew the door shut. I practically jumped out of my desk, where everyone else was totally unphased. They all looked at me, and I just laughed it off. Haha emotional scarring am I right? 

But in all seriousness- this is my letter of resignation. I wish I never was born at all because I don’t want to live. I’m lazy and I’m depressed. I’m too much of a cynic for my own good, and I’m convinced nobody cares about me, which is fine. I don’t expect them to, but life is pretty lonely sometimes. 

Most of my nights are spent emptily staring at the cars passing by on the highway across the street. Only I’m awake and I never feel more alone than those nights. I try to negotiate with my mind to let me sleep, but it never works. 

The day is okay, when I can distract myself. I feel like I’m always in hibernation. 

So I’m going to leave. I’m at peace with my decision. I just can’t do it anymore. 

To my family and friends, the note is tucked in next to my bed. 


To everyone else, please stay alive. It’s worth it. I’m a exception, but for you, please stay alive.

If you think about it, this life only matter for the short amount of time we live in it. And not only that, but our own view can really give us a sort of bias..


What good is living in this existence when the moment you are taken away from it, you cease to be.

As in, whats the point in living if you are destined to slumber in an endless darkness with no consciousness and no existence.


People can say the experiences are what make up living in this world. But that sounds pretentious and bias to me.

As when you look at existence and non-existence, nothing matters, as those memories will fade away and leave nothing left, other than those that would ""miss you.""


Without bias, there is no difference between existing and not existing. Its just the former has a stronger presence on us all because the latter is the great unknown that we are scared of.


I've realized that there is no greater purpose or reason to live in this world anymore (not saying that there ever was one.)

I terribly hated humanity. I mean, I just wanted to be left alone. But I am still sociable outside the class. Only working made me fell happy.

By some how, the god of death fucked me up so badly and many times. That develops some soft of PTSD. Having not kicked the bucket. Jesus, fucking trucks and vans and gangsters.

I started felling “numb”. You don’t know being absolutely insensitive fell like.

The whole class started to be afraid of me. They thought I was some kind of weirdo. 

Oh god, I just want to have a friend who don’t make joke about my illness in both physical and mental.

Only music kindly ease my pain. Also, in my country, metal illness is some kind of new definition.

I love Guitar, I even sold all of my collection for a tomson guitar.

One day at a grade 8th, I sit behind a very cute girl. Since I felt “numb”, I didn’t care much about her or everyone else.

She started to talk to me. Somehow, I felt interested in this individual. We become homies

At the end of 9th grade: I asked her out. She said: “I am going to America”. My Fucking Only Crush was going to America to study aboard.

I screamed out when going to home.

In my country, if you want go to high school, you have to sit for a test. Incredibly hard. And I fucked up badly. I cried out loud when my dad try to hold me down.

Suicide planning aka death by overdose on the top of moutain. I escape to a mountain which is 50km away from my home.

UnCalculatedly having a good time, and I also gained back some emotions, positive ones.

I discovered Rock n Roll music. The first song I heard was “Don’t Cry”. Thanks you Axl Roses,
Suddenly, I fell happy???

“Don’t you cry tonight, there is heaven above you baby”....

I don’t want to live in sorrow anymore. I WANTED TO FUCKING LIVE EVEN IF I HAVE TO FIGHT TO DEADTH.

After five days, I went home. Now i understand that if someone you know is toxic, don’t interact or give little thought about them. I don’t care about my relatives anymore.

I started practice guitar as insanely. Luckily I became incredibly good at it. 

Turned out, everyone fucked the test harder than me???! First luck in my entire life.

Now, I am a 19 year old boy, having a band, got alot of friends. I saved my homie too. Everyone in school consider me as a goofy boy.

Opinion not respected by many, even when I was in the right & proved it. Things I said used against me. Holidays taken but if I'm sick & can't work, being told I still have to.

I am dating a wonderful man, and have been for almost 3 years. He saved my life. But I know in my heart that it won’t last forever, and I’m glad it won’t because he really deserves so so so so much more than I can offer him. We won’t get married or have kids, because although he’s my soulmate, I don’t think I’m his. I have dreams a lot about him and some other woman, in the future and they seem happy, way happier than I make him. I want him to be happy and i know I’ll commit suicide in my lifetime.

Once he breaks up with me, I’m going to remain calm and reasonable until I move out (he owns the home) and I’m going to lie and say I’ve found a place but just go and end my life. We have a good relationship and rarely if ever fight. But I still wake up everyday knowing that he CAN and WILL leave my one day and it could be today so I’m always refreshing my plan, cleaning and tidying as to not leave him with too much to deal with when the time comes etc. 


Before him i used hard drugs, hypersexuality and risky behavior as coping skills. I haven’t worked in a few months due to my mental health and truly can’t imagine working  ever again. I self harmed for about 10 years but after the 3ish years before I met my bf where I was being insane and using drugs and sex everyday to cope, SH doesn’t do much anymore. 

I am sober but smoke weed everyday. I think about hanging myself in a tree atleast 10 times a day, in graphic detail. Sometimes I think about shooting my self in my car but I would feel bad for whoever has to clean it up. 

I know if anyone reads this they will say “you have to live for yourself, no one else” but I despise myself deeply. I think I bring no value to this world and if it were up to me I wouldn’t have existed to begin with so this comment is unhelp, thanks.",1,1,1
u/freaklikeme263,2,"Really worried about my brother, he was in the icu for 5 days for a suicide attempt last year and Idk what to do Little background, my brother goes to college out west, my family lives in the north east and I’m south, so we don’t always see him. Last year my parents told me they were worried about him but I brushed it off and said he was probably fine. I said this because even tho I come from a good family (PHDs, uhhh stuff might of been crazy but I was loved and provided for) I started abusing drugs from age 15-21. I’ve been clean for years but I figured they were naturally worried about him smoking pot and sleeping all day on break because I set such a bad example.  Then they got a call, he was in the icu and they weren’t sure he would make it because they didn’t have certain equipment if he went into cardiac arrest and everywhere else was full. I’m so grateful for his girlfriend for saving him, and I really don’t want to speak bad things into existence. (Not saying this to invalidate anyone, all suicide attempts are bad) but his was serious. He’d thought it out how he’d do it but when he went to do it that day he said it was slightly impulsive. I don’t want him to make another and pray if god forbid he does he’s alright.

My brother and I are close but we don’t really talk. I love him so much and I’m really greatful I got my relationship back with him. It took him like 3 years to forgive me after I got clean. Never like physically did anything to him or stole more than a few hundred over 6 years but I was a mess, I’d go missing, I’d yell, my dad used to tell him I was gonna die, ect. The worst was he was getting straight A’s and I was just not good and all of my parents attention was on me (which I rarely saw because I was not home and did not want it) and very little on him. I’ll never forget when I came home after 3 days of being gone one night and my dad said hi to me as if nothing had happened, and then yelled at my brother for something mild like leaving a dish out. I felt so bad.

I love my little brother so much. He’s so special and amazing and I just want him to have a happy healthy life. We don’t talk much other than when we’re both home but our relationship is repaired and he means the world to me. My dad told me they’re worried. He stopped talking to my mom, who he atleast talks to normally. He stopped taking meds, but they sounded unhelpful (not that he doesn’t need others) and last time he was on meds so idk.

Are there any suggestions of what to do? I could maybe open up to him about how I’ve almost done it and I know how bad it feels but I’m glad I didn’t most of the time and the times I’m not I’m grateful I get through when I feel better. I never talk about that stuff, I kind of have an attitude of shut up or kill yourself (never towards others, just myself. I feel like I should fix it or end it but not drag others into it) but he’s my little brother I’d talk about anything no matter how awkard or uncomfortable it is if I thought it might help. 

Idk what to do. What are helpful things even if it’s not me doing them. Can outside people even help? When I get like that I don’t talk to anyone. It makes me feel so empty and hollow knowing I might leave them and I can’t take it. I feel lost.

TL,dr brother had serious attempt a little over a year ago which left him in the icu for 5 days. He’s displaying the same withdrawing behavior again and my family can’t reach him because he’s at college. Idk what to do and wondered if anyone had any suggestions at all of something i or my mom or dad or maybe even his girlfriend could do to make him feel better. If I did contact her I would ask her not to tell because I don’t want to make him feel even worse, right now I’m not thinking of it as it seems like a boundary cross but I would if I thought it would help and he was in danger. Idk how much danger he’s in.",1,1,1
u/Resident_Animator600,3,The slow suicide of inaction.  Not trying to improve your lot is a terrible way to go.,3,3,3

u/throwaway58264927,10,"finally confident enough to go through with things tonight i actually feel optimistic for the first time in a while. i tested some parts yesterday and it went as smoothly as i could hope. i don’t think i have anything left to say to anyone. ideally i’d be able to ask everyone i care about if they has any final questions they want to ask or things they want to hear before i’m gone, but i know it would raise too many alarms and a psych ward visit is only going to delay my death because that’s what it did previously. 

i had a lot of “lasts” today, i wish there were a few more but that’s okay. last time hearing love music, last time eating pizza and chocolate, last time talking to my mom, last time getting high. there were some yesterday like my last time ever working on an art project and last time seeing the only friend i made in college. 

i should be sadder and i know it. i cried a lot earlier today. i typically go to the suicide bereavement subreddit to get it to dissuade me, but the times leading up to today have gotten less and less effective. i actually start feeling kind of angry and jealous now. i figured i should take that as a sign to finally go through with things, so i finalized some details and cleaned up my apartment to make it easier on everyone after i’m gone.

wish me luck, and i hope that the people who may or may not be reading this to be able to get better like i couldn’t do. not everyone has to die, i am just in a small percentage thats an exception. i hope you can find help if you can!",2,2,1
