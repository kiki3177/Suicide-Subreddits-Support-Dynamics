No matter how hard I try my life doesn’t seem to get better, but mostly sucks because my mindset swings like a fucking seesaw. I know I’m not alone, but this shit is getting harder by the day. Nothing I do is ever good enough for everyone. I’m tired of suffering from mental health issues, gender dysphoria, a loathing self hatred I can’t seem to shake. I just want to be a healthy, happy person, but it almost seems like no matter what I do, I’ll never get better, so what’s the use of going on anymore?
I don’t know. I really don’t. All I know is that all I do is sit in bed all day and play a game on my phone, hoping my life will get better with the little I’m able to do for myself, but my energy is gone, my hope is gone. Not hope in anyone else, but in myself getting better.
I should just shut my mouth and be dead at this point. Always speaking too soon, never able to come back. My whole life, I’ve been abused, raped, groomed, and it’s gotten to the point where I just feel like I deserve it, even if I know I don’t, I just can’t shake the feeling.
Everyone is turning their backs on me, friends, family, I have no one. I’m alone in real life. And sure, temporarily talking to someone not irl helps, but I need a real, physical person who can hug me and hold me and tell me they care and don’t want me dead, don’t want me to leave this fucking shithole that we call Earth.

u/thetenthsublevelof,6,"i attempted suicide 4 years ago and i thought i was getting better. this time it feels much more hopeless. i have no friends at all to talk to. when i attempted suicide last, i really didn’t want to die. it was really hard for me to do it and i ended up confessing that i tried it to my mother and she took me to the hospital and i recovered. 

i’m much more scared of myself now because i can’t find a reason not to do it. i was getting better (i think?) and i was starting to feel more happy about things but i’ve since started to get worse and worse i can no longer find a reason why i shouldn’t kill myself. i think if i try it this time it will work and i will follow through fully. 

i’m not sure what to do. maybe if i give it some time i will change my mind but everything is so overwhelming right now i don’t want to even think about continuing on. i have no friends so i have nobody to talk to about this. i just wish i had friends. it’s so hard to do everything alone.",1,1,1

I know I am beneath everything in this world, that even an insect is worth more, more intelligent and superior to me. I am a human pig. I shouldn't even know how to speak a language.

u/tyler174626,1,"Please read this if you have the time. I don't understand most things that happen in this world. I don't know what's going to happen to me. So I'm just going to write down what I do understand and what I do know.

I was eating in a restaurant with my family. I looked around at the walls, which were beautifully painted, and I just took a few moments to feel an emotion I can't describe. Everything around me will one day be nothing. All the walls around me will be broken down, every table, every chair, every door, everything. One day there won't even be a trace of my family and I. Maybe a trace of human life, but personal experiences will be lost to time. Every experience had in this place will be forgotten within one century. The table next to us had a birthday party going on. Within a century, nobody will remember that birthday. Nobody will remember that those servers and family members ever celebrated that birthday, unless explicitly recorded and kept. Seeing as that's most likely not happening, who will remember any human experience happening as I write this, and as you read this?

But I'm not saying that we should feel bad or nihilistic towards human experiences. I'm saying the opposite. Seeing as nobody will remember anything we do in a century, I'd like to cherish every moment I have. Even if I end up dead by my own hand one day, I find comfort in the prospect that I lived every moment. Maybe I'm alone in that.

I spend my life looking through a glass and wonder what's blocking me from experiencing everything fully. I'm too blind to see that it's my own reflection that blocks me from seeing life. In other words, I have come to realize that the only reason I have not been living life to its fullest is because of me. Trauma aside, and depression aside, I had been pushing away friends and family. And coming to this realization has really terrified me. If I lose this moment we are living in, will I ever feel this way again? 

It's almost 2:30 AM. I don't want to lose this feeling. I don't want to go to sleep. What if I never feel this way again? And I'm just telling this to random strangers, but that feels comforting to me. Nobody here knows me, they wouldn't ever notice if I vanished one day. But if they did know, they would care. And that's one thing that I don't understand about the world. Here are some more things I don't understand.

I don't understand how people can be so kind. I was raised by a father who cheated on my mother with his doctor. Now that doctor is my step mother. I will never consider my step mother family. I consider her evil, and she is. She threatened to kill all of us multiple times, yet my father just brushed it off and forgave her. But this isn't a trauma dump. What I'm getting at here is that I was raised into a mental state where I don't understand kindness. Sometimes I think there's another motive other than just kindness, sometimes I just don't believe it. But lately I've been getting better. I've been learning more about  how to better recognize when it's just kindness from people. It's difficult. My friends have been so extraordinarily kind to me, I love them all. I am so thankful for them. I just don't understand how they can be so kind when I'm really not that important.

I don't understand why people treat me like I'm special. Specifically my family. My parents have always treated me like I'm special, and that made me grow up very egotistical. I only stopped those egotistical behaviors about two years ago (I'm 14M for context). I just feel like I've been treated too well considering that I'm not that important at all. Since I started playing piano about six years ago I was always told that I had a special talent for it. I don't believe them. I just practiced a lot. I'm currently working on the piece Hungarian Rhapsody no. 2 by Liszt in case you're wondering. I don't have anything special about me. So why am I treated like I'm the next coming of Jesus?

I don't understand how so many bad things can happen to our family. Its like a constant stream of terrible things. My dad kicked my mom and us small children out of the house so he could be with his girlfriend, the same one that he cheated on my mom with. We were homeless for a few weeks. We eventually got a one story house with no basement, yet we can barely afford to pay rent and eat. My mom got a terrible job working in Healthcare. We were just in limbo for years. Then my mom finally got a better paying job, and you wanna know what happens immediately after? Rent raised 175 dollars. Now we're stuck in limbo. My sister got approved for a house. She had even transferred job locations, and ended her apartment lease(?). She was approved for the house, and then suddenly the sellers finances just fell through for some reason. That late in the proceedings. Now I'm waiting for the next terrible thing to happen to us. It's always been one after another, and there were many that I didn't even mention because that would extend this post even further.

I could go on and on. I don't understand many things in life. Maybe I'll continue tomorrow. It's 3 AM on the dot as of writing this sentence. And in a century, nobody will remember this. I'm going to be forgotten, which is slightly comforting to me. Nobody has to look at my life. I may be remembered for a few decades, if I ever have any grandchildren somehow, but one day everything about me will be forgotten. I just imagine that in 1,000 years, an outsider will look in at human society. Even if they study us for decades, they'll never truly know the human experience. And slowly, all the humanity will be drained out of humans once we are long extinct. I don't want to lose this feeling. If you read this whole thing, thank you. Maybe you can remember the experiences I've had for me once I'm gone. But I probably won't be gone any time soon.

u/zen___09,9,"What really is the point when we truly never get better? I’m trapped in my own mind & don’t see any other way out. I promised myself at 9 years old I’d eventually take my own life. I’m so sick of being alive. 

I’ve been extremely depressed and suicidal since I was around 9 years old, my first suicide attempt was near my 10th birthday. I’m now 21 years old and NOTHING has changed in fact I’m worse than I was to the point where I’m so desensitized to the idea of killing myself it’s all I talk and think about. I literally fantasise about my death and how much better life would be. I made a promise to myself as a child that I’d eventually take my own life it was just the matter of “when” but I’m that much of a failure that I can’t even do it even though I’m at peace with my death. They say life gets better and so on, but does it really? Or is that just another way to force you to continue being miserable on this earth. I’ve heard it all before, from psychiatrists to my own family but deep down I know it’s lies. Multiple psychologists, therapists, medications etc later and I’m still the same. I physically and mentally cannot continue like this anymore, I’m at the point that if someone was to grant me all my wishes I’d still chose to die. Im currently seeing a psychiatrist but I don’t have the heart to tell him that therapy is useless and what I really want is to die. No CBT, or any type of therapy is going to help me even if it did I’d still want to die.

I think about it a lot, and I think about what others have said to me, that is, I am my own downfall, and the truth is, you are right.

u/omgnoreason,1,"Hello people I just want to write that I am going to die soon. I absolutely love my family and my wife but I cannot function well. I cannot fit into any cultures. I come from a horrible background that led me to believing violence is the answer whenever there is any conflict, big or small. I was in therapy for 7 years and I believe I'm untreatable. I have complex PTSD diagnosis. 

I've always wanted to go back to Florida but it had been met with resistance every single time. I am both a great father and a horrible father too. I cannot stop hurting people for some reason. So somehow I was able to convince my wife to go to Florida with the children while we wait for Section 8 to finalize things and give me the voucher. I secretly am going to kill myself while I am home alone. There are methods where you cannot undo it. A rope and a chair. No one can muscle their way out of a noose. This will be my method. No one will notice I'm dead for a while, it will be the neighbors that smells the rot and start wondering and eventually call the police. They will find a note that says ""Finally you noticed I need help....""

Take care guys. The flight for my family is on Thursday and I will be dead the day I mail their replacement social security cards when I receive it.

u/DommyFutaMommy_,6,"I need an honest opinion I started texting with a girl about two months ago, after about a month we started texting really flirty and she also sent me n*des, I said from the beginning that I don’t want a relationship and she was okay with it.
After telling her again tho she got really angry at me and started telling me how bad of a person I was. 
For context we never actually met or talked irl, I only saw her irl twice and we only walked past each other.
After our argument she started telling me that she will be killing herself because of me. 
I told her that she shouldn’t do it a thousand times, I talked to her best friend about it and he told me to cut off Al contact with her, I did just that now.

u/ProposalScared8979,1,"Time is a loop and I'm trapped. I have to type this again because I accidentally refreshed the page. Sorry that this is so long and makes no sense.  
I've been stuck in this constant loop of changing my identity, leaving an impression that I'm doing so much better than before, throwing away that identity, and coming back to do the same thing over and over both online and irl.  
I was foolishly convincing myself after my last attempt that I'd never come back here, but nothing has fundamentally changed in my life, so I'm back. Not that it matters, but damn, I honestly thought that becoming an adult would eradicate most of my stress and problems. It didn't. I'm even more stressed now that I'm over 21 and I'm still stuck with my abusive family, and they're just now trying to figure out what to do with me now that I no longer benefit them.  
I thought after losing consciousness and waking up in vomit for the umpteenth time things would change. They saw me, but they didn't care. Just like before when I woke up soaked in blood and vomit, or the other time when I was passed out on the couch, or the other times.   
I told myself after waking up the last time to get help again. So, I got with another therapist whom I don't see much due to money and parents' reluctance to accept that I'll always be very mentally challenged (except when it's convenient for them to argue about which one made me ""r worded"", but my therapist is decent and I like them so far, but I know I'll just be persuaded again to ignore therapy, get on meds only to be forced off them again because they're not curing me and they make me ""fat"" and ""ugly"" and ""a zombie"", and repeat the cycle until one of us inevitably kicks the bucket.  
I can't hold down a job even when I want to because I can't function. I now know my parents don't have my best interest at heart at all thanks to therapy and some good friends I had, but my parents put these ideas in my head that all I need is them because I'm an idiot with horrible issues, but I'm also exaggerating those said issues because I'm a lazy, stupid piece of shit who doesn't love anyone or anything.   
I don't even know what I am, who I am, or what I want. I feel like a fucking puppet.  
I have a driver's license miraculously, but I'm not allowed to drive much even though my parents have age-related impairments that cause them to have difficulty with driving. Oh well. I honestly don't even like to drive anymore because every time I do, I get reprimanded for speeding or driving recklessly by them.  
I lost my cats (well, they were cats that were born at the house to a stray who used to come around frequently before she passed away) because my parents insisted they stay outside. I begged them to take them to the vet, get them fixed and treated for parasites, and keep them inside, but no, that would be too much work for them and the dog wouldn't stop bothering them. (Our dog loves cats. He knew those two since they were little. They were actually around the same age.)  
Now Mom and Dad want to adopt a rescued cat to throw outside so we can have that same issue as before. Also, it's probably obvious, but the family is abusive to the animals, too.  
Every day is the same trauma and pain. Trying to talk everyone out of doing stupid shit, being called stupid because my brain and body don't work, getting threatened by my belligerent cousin because I'm an idiot, telling my parents (not like they care enough because I'm an idiot), looking for work knowing damn well I won't be able to function normally on the job, studying for school, and going to bed at midnight only to be woken up by my awful physical pain (I have several issues with my GI tract and suffer from insanely painful head and neck pain).   
I don't want to fail another attempt, but I'm inevitably going to do it again. By understanding the pattern of my life, I know I'll most likely fail again and end up at the hospital or on the floor covered in bodily fluids once more. If I could be guaranteed a death that's quick, I'd do it. I just need to get out of here, but it feels as though the universe is telling me to kms, so that's my only solution, I think. Even if I do make it out of my parents' grip and my cousin dies of an OD or something of that nature, I still feel like it's only necessary that I try again (and hopefully succeed) because I'm too stupid, weak, bizarre, and physically ill to really survive on my own and my parents would try their hardest to drag me back into that hellhole if I slip up once.   
It also doesn't help that it feels like my schizophrenia has gotten worse, at least with the disorganized thinking and the crazy hallucinations I get. I also feel dumber because I can't get my thoughts together in a coherent way at all. I don't even think this makes sense.",2,2,1
u/Fabulous_Ad2131,5,"Might regret this I’ve never made an actual post on Reddit before. Figured this would be my first one. Might be my last one, who knows.

I feel like I just need to… talk. But I can’t do that to anyone in my life right now. My family’s gone through too much already, I’ve put them through too much, to burden them further. They deserve to be happy, dammit. My best friend isn’t comfortable with emotions and I can’t knowingly make someone uncomfortable with my bullshit. The rest of my ‘friends’ are really just my coworkers, all of which have their own lives and families, some of which probably want me away from them anyway. The only person who I would be able to talk to would be my mother… but she’s been dead for six years now. I lost her when I was 15.

I’m spending her anniversary alone this year. Physically and mentally. And it’s getting extremely hard to stay.

I’m the reason my family was broken further apart following my mom’s death. I would argue I’m even the cause of my mom’s death. If I had just done things differently, been a better daughter, maybe she would have still been here. But maybes don’t exist. And I feel like I can’t even recognize the person that stares back at me when I look in a mirror. 

I’m becoming colder. More distant. Becoming a shell. As the days, months and years tick by, I feel like I’m increasingly losing sense of myself. I can’t express my emotions anymore, I can’t communicate how I feel. If I let something slip, I immediately feel shame and anxiety well up inside me. My family has managed to find happiness without me- in some aspects, it’s because I’m no longer physically around them. 

When I hear my younger coworkers talk about their lives, I end up thinking about all that I can’t do. Despite being their age, I can’t have the same aspirations, goals, or advantages they have. Because I ruined my own life. I live by myself with my dog with just enough income to support us both. But that’s it.

I went from being the bright, gifted kid with a promising future ahead of her to what I am now… it’s a damn shame. And I have no one to blame but myself. 

I wish I could just die and be over with everything. But my dog still needs me. And my dad would be absolutely distraught. I can’t be with him due to his partner hating me, but he still loves me a lot and I can’t make him bury another loved one. And i know my death will just cause him more trouble than I’m worth. 

But, I’m so tired. Tired from fighting. Tired from pretending everything is okay, that I don’t need anyone. Tired of facing everything alone and not having anyone to lean on. Tired of hating myself and knowing no one deserves to have to be around me and that subjecting them to do that would just be plain cruel.

It should have been me that died all those years ago, not her.

u/Majestic_Garlic3577,4,"Makes no sense Hello, 

I’m (f28) new here. 

Throughout my entire adult life I’ve struggled with  (and been diagnosed with) clinical depression and anxiety. I started taking antidepressants when I was 16 after an unexpected, unrelated medical diagnosis. 

I mean, I’ve definitely had trauma in my life - who hasn’t? - that hasn’t been overly dealt with but I don’t think that that trauma should be bringing me to the brink of suicide. 

Anyway, this past weekend I went to the emergency room as I was at my breaking point … however, unless you have the gun, pill bottle, or knife in hand, the hospital in my region is useless. So, I was sent home even more upset for putting myself in a vulnerable and embarrassing situation to get absolutely no help. 

I’m just perpetually unsatisfied with life and I’m over it. On the other hand, I have so much to be thankful for 

- I have two healthy kids 
- I graduate from my dream program on Friday 
- I’ve started to lose weight 
- I’m going to Europe in two weeks 

Yet, I’m just miserable all the time. 

I know I’m addicted to pot … which some people may find silly … but it helps numb my reality and pot makes me less irritable. 

My personal narrative is horrendous and I would never speak to others the way I speak to myself. I have no energy or desire to get out of bed in the morning. 

I feel like I’m watching myself sabotage my life and I can’t/don’t know what to do to stop it before I go off the handlebars 

I lie, I cheat on my partner (which yes, we have a toxic relationship but he genuinely loves me and would do anything for me), and I steal (mostly groceries cause I’m poor and everything is so expensive in Ontario). I just feel like this shit person all the time and my life isn’t going to get better. 

My kids used to be a protective factor, but I’m finding that it is slowly weakening. I feel like a shit mom as it is. I had my first son when I was 17, so I feel like I totally fucked that up and didn’t take advantage of that precious time.  

I don’t know where I’m going with this but maybe someone will hear my story and have some advice. 

*before all the hate comes, I know cheating is wrong and I’ve tried breaking up with my partner multiple times but he’s committed to being with me. We’ve been together 8 years and have a 1.5 year old together.  My (M32) partner is aware of all of the infidelity and chooses to stay. I know my brain is fucked and maybe my emotional neglect and lack of stability as a child contributes to this issue.",1,2,1

I an 16 and i live with my parents. I will go to school till I’m 19 (school goes 13 years wher with live from the age of 6) and I have no money. 

I have no drivers license (I can only do it once I’m 17, and then drive on my own without my parents once I’m 18) and the drivers licens alone costs 5,-7,000$. 
I don’t have a job either because I can’t have one without my parents approval. 
My bank account is alone connected to my moms so whatever money I would have would be controlled by her. 


The things I have/had to endure are sexual/physical when I was younger, and now mostly verbally or humiliating. 

I won’t go into details but o can’t do this anymore. I doubt my decision of wanting to move/run away sometimes because my father is wealthy and I have a roof over my head with food in the fridge (things my parents didn’t have) and I’m so spoiled that I want to die because some things they did in the past or some things they say to me?

u/Kingblingmike,1,"It would just be too selfish of me I’ve recently fallen into a deep depression kickstarted by telling my closest friend I had feelings for her and she didn’t reciprocate. I fucked that whole thing up and it lead to me not being allowed to contact her in any sort of way.  Our whole friend group knows what happened and i think about what they think of me everyday. Am I a loser? And I dumb for thinking anybody could have ever liked me romantically?  Backstory btw I’ve been homeschooled my whole life and have never developed feelings for a girl ever until now.  I still care about her so much but the thought that she hasn’t thought about me once or how she could do so much better than me haunts me. 


Over time the depression from that subsided greatly but now I just flat out hate myself. I’ve always kinda just burried these self hate thoughts deep deep down but I can’t live in this false sense of reality where I look who I am anymore. I hate the way I look, talk, interact with others, like just everything about me. I want to die just to rid myself of nights long of sadness and crying because I’m alone and nobody really likes me and they talk shit about me and I hate who I am and all my friends hate me. I’ve never received any complements or any type of supportive reassurance from anybody in my 20 years of life so I must be right??? Right?????   I think my friend might care but they only give me help if I directly ask for it. Nobody ever reaches out to check if I’m okay I feel like such a burden if I go to talk to people about my feelings. My therapist is cool and all but it’s just not the same as talking with my peers. 


I just want to kill myself but I can’t. My mom and dad will have to live with their son being dead and my friends have to live with their friend being dead and putting that eternal guilt and grievance on people is just too selfish for me to do even though I’ll have eternal happiness.

If I took action to the things I cried about wanting but never did anything about, it would be another step in the foundation. Except I did that and now I'm staring at a sunny day contemplating if hanging myself is really such a bad way to go. Failed with cutting an arty, failed at ODing, I'm too afraid of heights to ever jump from one. I started a thing with someone and instantly I was hovering by the phone waiting for a response, wanting to do whatever I could to please them despite the fact that it was so far out of my realm of comfort that it spiraled me even more. I'm elated in the middle of it, but as soon as there is any kind of distance, I'm suddenly questioning everything...and so I feel guiltier because this is what I had strived for, but I dont trust them. I question every move they make because they might be laughing at me behind my back. They might be setting me up as some sort of joke because at the end of it, they're part can be wiped away easily, while my attempts to please them are noticable. And so I hate myself even more for falling for what everyone else would say is an obvious trap. I don't know why I'm trying anymore. I don't know what I'm doing. I just want to be done.

i cant live with myself anymore. i think i’m still in denial about that fact, but truth is i deserve to die. i couldn’t live with myself if what i fear i did is true. and i cant live with myself not knowing. i see no future for me, i honestly don’t deserve one.

Even though we had a great time, it just didn’t work between us. A little backstory about my boyfriend. Before we met, he was already mentally unstable. He had a terrible relationship with his family, and he didnt have many friends. He was planning to kill himself, if I haven’t gotten in his life. He was kinda friends with my, back then, crush, and i wanted to get closer to my crush. So i got friends with my ex boyfriend and we developed immediately a great friendship. While I was trying to get closer to my crush, my ex boyfriend was in love with me. After my crush rejected me, I cried myself to my ex boyfriend. While we got closer, I got feelings for him. Looking back now, I only got feelings because my crush made me desperate and my ex just happened to be there and give me attention.
I didnt really love him, i just liked the attention. But after some time, i got real feelings. We got together and had a great time. Now here comes the issue. We are both muslims, and in our religion, a relationship other than marriage is forbidden. But my stupid me did it anyway. After summer break, I began to wear the hijab. Now comes the problem. Dont get me wrong, my ex was great. He loved me dearly, got me whatever I wanted and was there for me. Why did I break up then? I don’t love him anymore. I can’t control my feelings and I‘m surely sorry, but it is not my fault. 



So, after I missed him the summer long, since we were both in our home country and couldn’t see each other, seeing him again wasn’t really something. I still loved him, but a few weeks later I realized I lost feelings. And because of the hijab, I wanted to be closer to my religion. I love my religion. But he seemed like he didnt care. 
And that was an issue. Yes, he wanted to marry me, he still does. But he isnt religious. And since i lost feelings at some point, I broke up with him a few days ago. I cried and left after I told him. I unfollowed him on snap, where we had always talked, and gave him the option to talk to me over WhatsApp if he has any problems, because I knew about his mental health.
And here it comes. He tells me over chatt that he is going to kill himself because I broke up with him. I was crying. I didnt know what to do. I wanted to have no contact with him, but that would give him the jumb into his death. I tried to talk him out of it, tell him he‘s going to hell because its forbidden in our religion. He didnt want to listen. The only way he was a little bit happy was if we stayed friends. I didn’t want to, but to keep him alive i did. He told me i am the love of his life and he couldn’t live without me. But I dont want to be in any contact with him. My friends tell me to finally block him, but I know that would push his death. He is a little bit happier because we are friends, but he still has the suicidal thoughts. Quote him „I can’t do this anymore“ I’m helping him to heal, but because of my help, he thinks we can still be something. But I dont want to be. And I dont know what to do, can you help me?

If I check myself into a mental hospital or seek more intensive therapy for extreme depression, anxiety, ptsd, and suicidal ideations will my daughter be taken from me and/or could her father use it against me in court to take her from me? 


long story short I was with someone for about 7 years I was 19 he was 27 now I’m 26 and he is 34 and we are going to have a 2 year old soon, we are not together as he was abusive and showed signs abuse was going to escalate physically and I didn’t want my child growing up in that kind of environment so I broke it off and he went crazy and just so much has happened I’m in a horrible spot with my mental health I feel I spend every second of every day weighing out the pros and cons of if I should die or not, if my daughter is better without me, if everyone is better, if I’m already in hell so it won’t even matter if I die etc.

I have raised my daughter solely on my own, I was a caretaker for my dying father my entire pregnancy, then I sat by his bedside with her at 3 months old as he took his last breath. Nothing has been easy. I’ve been “the rock” for everyone but nobody checked in on me and I feel like all the stress and trauma and grief I didnt get to grieve and so much more are all spilling out of me and life is not beautiful to me. I want to be with my dad. He was my best friend. But I know, I KNOW my daughter NEEDS me since her father is a nightmare and his whole family are abusive narcissists and sociopaths and I didn’t bring her in this world for her to be brought up uneducated and just shitty just fucking shitty. I know her life would be hell if I killed myself. I feel so selfish and guilty for even being in this state of despair right now. 

After the split I did everything right, stayed calm, collected, classy. He did the absolute complete opposite. Because I believe children should never be used as “pawns” we started doing a split custody schedule. Which was fine until these past two weeks he has had her (it’s mainly his mom taking care of her though)

Regardless of how hard I have tried to stay cordial for the sake of our daughter he and his mother have told me he is going to court to get “legitimized” (which is really convienant he only wants to do that once he knows court will inevitably be involved) that is the only reason he is putting on this whole show and is “watching his daughter” after almost two years of it being just me and her. 

I can’t afford a lawyer, I feel hopeless. Helpless. Alone.
My only reason to live is to love and care for my sweet beautiful brilliant daughter, if anything happened to her or if she got taken from me I would go meet my father again without any hesitation. 

I fear I am in a horrible spot as if I do not recieve help I will end up dying and if I do and lose my daughter because of it I will also die.

I’ve tried to telling people my thoughts in past but they just, you know, being assholes.   
1.  I was having a panic attack at school. My history teacher saw me. While I was busy imagining myself dead, he told me to get back to work. I know what he can’t hear my thoughts. But I’m pretty sure if one of your students is hyperventilating and that student is notorious for self-harming (as in cutting themselves), you should probably, I don’t know, SUGGEST THEY GO TO THE GUIDANCE COUNSELOR! FINE, EVEN IF YOU DONT WANNA DO THAT YOU COULD AT LEAST ASK IF THEIR OKAY OR LET THEM STEP OUTSIDE OR MAYBE EVEN LEAVE THEM ALONE! BUT FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, PLEASE DON‘T TELL THEM TO GLUE A TINY PAPER IN THIER JOURNAL! YOU DON‘T KNOW HOW MUCH I WANTED TO SMACK THAT FUCKER!  
2. About a year ago, I had an emotionally abusive grandfather and a dysfunctional family. One day, I was playing Splatoon 3 (cool game, you should try it), and next thing you know, my grandpa starts bleeding out and falls on the floor. Im not gonna go too much into detail, but let’s just say, he died. IN FRONT OF ME! What was I supposed to do!? I was 12!? Anyway, my dad tried to console be by telling me that my grandfather loved me despite all the rude, hatful, terrible, mean, awful, barbaric, damaging, cruel, horrible things he told me. Good one.…  
4. I go to a recovery group at my church (by the way, I’m not religious, so I don’t exactly fit in). I don’t really talk much, but I’m very vocal on the Internet (obviously). They say I’m selfish for not sharing and I’m wasting my time there. My home life is terrible and I have no friends, this makes me lonely. So, my church group that I don’t like is the only place we’re I can not think about killing myself. They make me laugh sometimes, but they don’t like me and I don’t like them. Why do I put myself through this?

5. I have this thing called Maladaptive Daydreaming. A lot of you probably never even heard of it. It’s when someone‘s daydreams become harmful. That’s the best way I can explain it. But I feel like no one really gets it. Imagine this, I’m in my church, we go around in circle sharing our struggles. Random Person: ”Hey guys! My name‘s Olivia, and I struggle with depression!” Random Person: ”Hey guys! My name‘s Lisa, and I struggle with Anxiety and Schizophrenia!” Me: “Hey guys! My name‘s Brianna, and I struggle with Maladaptive Daydreamin!” You see how sounds?

6. I’m bored

u/interesting_alien,4,"To my younger self. (A last letter before everything goes down) Hey kiddo,

I never knew you grew up so big! You are probably enjoying yourself in the sun with friends without caring the meaning of the world that surrounds you. You were so innocent and I would kill to have that feeling once again. I would like to apologize because I couldn’t really protect you from reality. You were so young and happy. You expected the world to protect you from any harm, but everything went the opposite way and you were always the one who got hurt. You always felt alone in times you needed an adult to comfort you. They think it’s the best idea to leave you alone and fight. You never really had anything to fight with because you were young and never really understood the way the world flows. It wasn’t your fault. You were just trying to protect yourself. They never really understand you and your feelings. 

I know you’re still there somewhere in the dark waiting for someone to save you. You always prayed to whatever God that created you for someone to rescue you from all the pain and suffering you’ve been fighting for years. You would always think if there’s even a God out there? Were you just a pawn of entertainment that they have, patiently waiting for you to die. Is there even a Devil? Were they part of this scheme, this horrible life. Did you do something wrong in your past life that you have to suffer this way? Why are you one of the people who just can’t get lucky? Can’t just take a break? All you ever wanted was to be loved. It’s just a simple thing you wished to receive. You desperately look for it through items you bought to the worlds you created in your head. However, they were all temporary. A distraction to keep you away from your thoughts. 

After finding someone that you knew would give you the absence of love you needed, you accidentally ruined it. How can someone love somebody if they weren’t even taught to love themselves? Throughout the battles of your life, you always choose the lonely road. You thought choosing this road will evidently steer you away from those who hurted you. However in the end, it all hit you so hard in the back. You seem to look at the world differently now after that happened. 

The loneliness you felt through the years was the only one who gave you comfort, like a way for you to breathe a little even though it hurts. It was the only feeling you could remember. The only thing that stayed. People told you to move on, let go and heal. You would think, who do they think they are? Telling you that. Why all of the sudden they care? They don’t understand you and they don’t know what you’ve gone through. How tired you are even though you’re still young. You were just a kid. It wasn’t your fault, but saying the phrase would let you think the opposite way. Was it your fault? Everything that happened. Was it because you only thought of yourself and you see things differently than others. You were young and you already questioned yourself, what’s the point of fighting, if in the end, you’ll get pierced again by the same pain. You should've got used to it but didn’t. 

Stop staring at me with those innocent eyes to convince me to stay.

One day, I’ll cut off everything and will be free.

I’ll probably meet you again in another life holding another family who will love you dearly. On that day, I wouldn’t regret cutting our lives short and you wouldn’t suffer from the pain that it caused. In another life, both of us will be completely different from one another. We won’t have any memories of our past life, and hopefully, we’ll both be happy.

A very busy highway is right in front of my workplace, and there is nothing I want more than to run into oncoming traffic. I'm too much of a pussy to go through with it. I dunno what to do with myself.",1,1,1

u/Centip3des,4,Transgender and suicidal I don’t care what audience this reaches supportive or not. I’m so tired and I can’t handle being transgender anymore. It literally affects all parts of my days and life. I’m too tired to even push myself to try to affirm myself. I’m just waiting to find a good option/way to end it. I’m scared in my obituary and funeral they will misgender me. That’s one of the only things keeping me from killing myself.,1,1,1
u/Mysterious_Wheel_965,1,I feel like a failure I feel like everything is going wrong and everyone hates me. My dad is telling me I’m fat and out of shape. My boyfriend is making me feel worthless and hurt and telling me I’m a bad girlfriend and all I want is to sob and cut my body apart and starve myself I hate myself. I haven’t had thoughts of suicide in a while but since getting back to living near my boyfriend I feel like everything is going down hill. Over the summer I had an amazing community and support system and I felt happy and safe for the first time and now I feel like I’m loosing all my power and safety as a person. He makes me feel like I don’t deserve love and support. I want to sob and run away. I want someone to love and support me the way I support others. Help.,1,1,1
u/tempaccount12935,2,"i lost everything a few days ago and i don’t know how to cope with it Hi, so about a week ago now my girlfriend of just over 1 year and i broke up, im young and this was my first long term relationship so as you can imagine im not exactly taking it easy, the breakup was mostly my fault as my mental health issues ultimately got the better of me and ruined the person i was in the first half of our relationship. Not only is the guilt of this killing me but shortly after the break up she decided that the relationship was nothing to her and that she hates me and made me lose all of my friends because of it, im now completely alone with noone to turn to. I miss her so much the memories are driving me crazy and it seems now she’s going to get with one of my (former) best friends and the thought of this is driving me insane i just don’t know what to do anymore i have nothing and noone and i don’t know how much longer i can go on",1,1,1
